# Availability of evidence and comparative effectiveness for surgical versus drug interventions: an overview of systematic reviews

This is the underlying code and data for the article w/ the title above. It aims to assess the rate of comparisons of surgery and drugs in cases where such comparisons are anticipated by authors of the review. For this study the summary effect of each comparison was extracted as were the different arms. Manually we classified the direction of effects using the 95%CI of the effect. Furthermore a reanalysis was performed w/ standardized methods to observe the direction of effects after using best practices for meta-analysis. It is a wide and heterogeneous project and studies specifically the body of evidence found in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR).

The code is found within the different sections the majority is found in the review_data for bias detection, meta-analysis and primary outcome analysis with the review level data that has been extracted as well as all included reviews tabulated for availability of comparisons and specialty, the studied disease in the review as. The code for RCT descriptives and for exploration for what part of the literature the results favoring surgery are published is under rct_data as well as the rct level data (RoB data, duplicates assessment, journal of publication and the raw data).
