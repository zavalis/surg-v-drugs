This is the underlying code and data for the article w/ the title above. It aims to assess the rate of comparisons of surgery and drugs in cases where such comparisons are anticipated by authors of the review. For this study the summary effect of each comparison was extracted as were the different arms. Manually we classified the direction of effects using the 95%CI of the effect.
