0,CD013278.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Nonsteroidal anti‚Äö√Ñ√™inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to prevent or treat a PDA. There are concerns regarding adverse effects of NSAIDs in preterm infants. Controversy exists on whether early targeted treatment of a hemodynamically significant (hs) PDA improves clinical outcomes. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of early treatment strategies versus expectant management for an hs‚Äö√Ñ√™PDA in reducing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 31 May 2019), Embase (1980 to 31 May 2019), and CINAHL (1982 to 31 May 2019). An updated search was run on 2 October 2020 in the following databases: CENTRAL via CRS Web and MEDLINE via Ovid. We searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomized trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs in which early pharmacological treatment, defined as treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth, was compared to no intervention, placebo or other non‚Äö√Ñ√™pharmacological expectant management strategies for treatment of an hs‚Äö√Ñ√™PDA in preterm (< 37 weeks‚Äö√Ñ√¥ postmenstrual age) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) infants. Data collection and analysis We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Our primary outcome was all‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality during hospital stay. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for selected clinical outcomes. Main results We included 14 RCTs that enrolled 910 infants. Seven RCTs compared early treatment (defined as treatment initiated by seven days of age) versus expectant management and seven RCTs compared very early treatment (defined as treatment initiated by 72 hours of age) versus expectant management. No difference was demonstrated between early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth) for an hs‚Äö√Ñ√™PDA for the primary outcome of ‚Äö√Ñ√≤all‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (6 studies; 500 infants; typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; typical RD ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.02; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.07 to 0.03; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), or other important outcomes such as surgical PDA ligation (4 studies; 432 infants; typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.80; typical RD ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.03; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.09 to 0.03; very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), chronic lung disease (CLD) (4 studies; 339 infants; typical RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.29; typical RD ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.03; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.10 to 0.03; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (2 studies; 171 infants; typical RR 0.83,95% CI 0.32 to 2.16; typical RD ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.01; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.08 to 0.06; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (5 studies; 473 infants; typical RR 2.34,95% CI 0.86 to 6.41; typical RD 0.04; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.08; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Infants receiving early treatment in the first seven days after birth were more likely to receive any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (2 studies; 232 infants; typical RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.83; typical RD 0.57; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). No difference was demonstrated between very early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first 72 hours after birth) for an hs‚Äö√Ñ√™PDA for the primary outcome of ‚Äö√Ñ√≤all‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (7 studies; 384 infants; typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.53; typical RD ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.03; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.09 to 0.04; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence) or other important outcomes such as surgical PDA ligation (5 studies; 293 infants; typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.17; typical RD ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.01; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.05 to 0.02; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), CLD (7 studies; 384 infants; typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.08; typical RD ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.05; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.13 to 0.04; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), severe IVH (4 studies, 240 infants; typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.93; typical RD ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.02; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.07 to 0.04; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), NEC (5 studies; 332 infants; typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.21; typical RD 0.01; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™0.04 to 0.06; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence) and neurodevelopmental impairment (1 study; 79 infants; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31 for moderate/severe cognitive delay at 18 to 24 months; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.71 for moderate/severe motor delay at 18 to 24 months; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.78 for moderate/severe language delay at 18 to 24 months; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Infants receiving very early treatment in the first 72 hours after birth were more likely to receive any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (4 studies; 156 infants; typical RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.05; typical RD 0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79; very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Very early treatment, however, shortened the duration of hospitalization compared to expectant management (4 studies; 260 infants; MD ‚Äö√Ñ√™5.35 days; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™9.23 to ‚Äö√Ñ√™1.47; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Early or very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of an hs‚Äö√Ñ√™PDA probably does not reduce mortality in preterm infants (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of hs‚Äö√Ñ√™PDA may increase NSAID exposure (low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence) without likely reducing CLD (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), severe IVH or NEC (low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of hs‚Äö√Ñ√™PDA also increases NSAID exposure (very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Very early treatment probably does not reduce surgical PDA ligation, severe IVH or NEC (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), and may not reduce CLD or neurodevelopmental impairment (low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Additional large trials that specifically include preterm infants at the highest risk of PDA‚Äö√Ñ√™attributable morbidity, are adequately powered for patient‚Äö√Ñ√™important outcomes and are minimally contaminated by open‚Äö√Ñ√™label treatment are required to explore if early targeted treatment of hs‚Äö√Ñ√™PDA improves clinical outcomes. There are currently two trials awaiting classification and two ongoing trials exploring this question. Plain language summary Early treatment versus expectant management of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants Review question Does early treatment (initiated within the first seven days after birth) or very early treatment (initiated within the first 72 hours after birth) of a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with nonsteroidal anti‚Äö√Ñ√™inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared to expectant management (without use of NSAIDs) improve outcomes in preterm infants? Background PDA is a common complication in preterm or low birth weight infants. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA often remains open and may contribute to life‚Äö√Ñ√™threatening complications. Medications such as NSAIDs are used to prevent or treat a PDA before it becomes symptomatic. However, there are concerns regarding the side‚Äö√Ñ√™effects of NSAIDs in preterm infants. There is controversy on whether early treatment of a symptomatic PDA improves outcomes in preterm infants. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‚Äö√Ñ√™birth‚Äö√Ñ√™weight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants with a symptomatic PDA diagnosed using a combination of specific clinical features and ultrasound of the heart. The included studies compared early treatment, or very early treatment of a symptomatic PDA with NSAIDs compared to expectant management without the use of NSAIDs. The search is up to date as of 2 October 2020. Key results This review of 14 clinical trials (910 infants) found that early or very early treatment of a symptomatic PDA does not reduce death or other poor clinical outcomes in preterm infants. Early or very early treatment, on the other hand, appears to increase the number of preterm infants exposed to NSAIDs. There are currently two trials awaiting classification and two ongoing trials exploring this question. Certainty of evidence According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to moderate but was moderate for the most important outcome of death.",Early treatment versus expectant management of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus for preterm infants,Mitra and  S; Scrivens and  A; von Kursell and  AM; Disher and  T,3,2,2,,3,yes
1,CD005624.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence, causing varicose veins and venous insufficiency, makes up the majority of lower‚Äö√Ñ√™limb superficial venous diseases. Treatment options for GSV incompetence include surgery (also known as high ligation and stripping), laser and radiofrequency ablation, and ultrasound‚Äö√Ñ√™guided foam sclerotherapy. Newer treatments include cyanoacrylate glue, mechanochemical ablation, and endovenous steam ablation. These techniques avoid the need for a general anaesthetic, and may result in fewer complications and improved quality of life (QoL). These treatments should be compared to inform decisions on treatment for varicosities in the GSV. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011. Objectives To assess the effects of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), endovenous steam ablation (EVSA), ultrasound‚Äö√Ñ√™guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), cyanoacrylate glue, mechanochemical ablation (MOCA) and high ligation and stripping (HL/S) for the treatment of varicosities of the great saphenous vein (GSV). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED databases, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 November 2020. We undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) treating participants for varicosities of the GSV using EVLA, RFA, EVSA, UGFS, cyanoacrylate glue, MOCA or HL/S. Key outcomes of interest are technical success, recurrence, complications and QoL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, applied Cochrane's risk of bias tool, and extracted data. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We identified 11 new RCTs for this update. Therefore, we included 24 RCTs with 5135 participants. Duration of follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up ranged from five weeks to eight years. Five comparisons included single trials. For comparisons with more than one trial, we could only pool data for 'technical success' and 'recurrence' due to heterogeneity in outcome definitions and time points reported. All trials had some risk of bias concerns. Here we report the clinically most relevant comparisons. EVLA versus RFA Technical success was comparable up to five years (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.38; 5 studies, 780 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence); over five years, there was no evidence of a difference (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.41; 1 study, 291 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). One study reported recurrence, showing no clear difference at three years (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.99; 291 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), but a benefit for RFA may be seen at five years (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.52 to 5.06; 291 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). EVLA versus UGFS Technical success may be better in EVLA participants up to five years (OR 6.13, 95% CI 0.98 to 38.27; 3 studies, 588 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), and over five years (OR 6.47, 95% CI 2.60 to 16.10; 3 studies, 534 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in recurrence up to three years and at five years (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.36; 2 studies, 443 participants; and OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.87; 2 studies, 418 participants; very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence, respectively). EVLA versus HL/S Technical success may be better in EVLA participants up to five years (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.23; 6 studies, 1051 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). No clear difference in technical success was seen at five years and beyond (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.50; 5 studies, 874 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Recurrence was comparable within three years and at 5 years (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.29; 7 studies, 1459 participants; and OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.76; 7 studies, 1267 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence, respectively). RFA versus MOCA There was no clear difference in technical success (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.06 to 54.15; 3 studies, 435 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), or recurrence (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.81; 3 studies, 389 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Long‚Äö√Ñ√™term data are not available. RFA versus HL/S No clear difference in technical success was detected up to five years (OR 5.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 50.81; 2 studies, 318 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence); over five years, there was no evidence of a difference (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.69; 1 study, 289 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). No clear difference in recurrence was detected up to three years (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.51; 4 studies, 546 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence); but a possible long‚Äö√Ñ√™term benefit for RFA was seen (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.75; 1 study, 289 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). UGFS versus HL/S Meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis showed a possible benefit for HL/S compared with UGFS in technical success up to five years (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.94; 4 studies, 954 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), and over five years (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30; 3 studies, 525 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). No clear difference was detected in recurrence up to three years (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.77; 3 studies, 822 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), and after five years (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.71; 3 studies, 639 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Complications were generally low for all interventions, but due to different definitions and time points, we were unable to draw conclusions (very‚Äö√Ñ√™low certainty evidence). Similarly, most studies evaluated QoL but used different questionnaires at variable time points. Rates of QoL improvement were comparable between interventions at follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Our conclusions are limited due to the relatively small number of studies for each comparison and differences in outcome definitions and time points reported. Technical success was comparable between most modalities. EVLA may offer improved technical success compared to UGFS or HL/S. HL/S may have improved technical success compared to UGFS. No evidence of a difference was detected in recurrence, except for a possible long‚Äö√Ñ√™term benefit for RFA compared to EVLA or HL/S. Studies which provide more evidence on the breadth of treatments are needed. Future trials should seek to standardise clinical terminology of outcome measures and the time points at which they are measured. Plain language summary Which procedures are best for treating varicose veins in the leg? Key messages We are uncertain about which treatments are best for varicose veins because we found only a small number of studies that compared the different types of treatment, and because studies differed in how they measured results. ‚Äö√Ñ√™ All currently available varicose vein treatments are similar in terms of whether the treatment fully destroys the vein, or stops blood from pooling in the legs, or both (technical success). ‚Äö√Ñ√™ We need studies that provide more evidence on all the available treatments. What are varicose veins? Varicose veins are bulging, twisty veins close to the skin‚Äö√Ñ√¥s surface that usually occur in the legs. They are caused by chronic venous insufficiency, which is when your veins do not manage to help blood to flow back up to your heart efficiently, and blood pools in your legs. About one‚Äö√Ñ√™third of adults are thought to have chronic venous insufficiency. Women are more likely than men to have varicose veins. Varicose veins can be painful, itchy and unsightly, especially when standing and walking. Occasionally, they may result in skin changes or sores (ulcers) on the leg that take more than two weeks to heal. How are varicose veins treated? Varicose veins can be treated using a variety of procedures. Traditionally, surgery was used to remove the main surface vein (called the ‚Äö√Ñ√≤great saphenous vein‚Äö√Ñ√¥, which runs from the groin to the ankle) and any connected varicose veins through small openings in the leg. People having this procedure (known as ‚Äö√Ñ√≤high ligation and stripping‚Äö√Ñ√¥) need to have a general anaesthetic to make them unconscious and stop them from feeling pain or moving while the surgery is done. More recently, several treatments have emerged where the procedure is done inside the vein (endovenous), using a very fine tube. These treatments involve sealing the main vein in the thigh by deliberately damaging the vein wall. There are two main types of treatment: ‚Äö√Ñ√™ heat‚Äö√Ñ√™based, where heat energy from lasers, radio waves or steam, is used to damage the vein wall; ‚Äö√Ñ√™ chemical‚Äö√Ñ√™based, where chemicals (including foam or glue) are used to damage and consequently seal the vein. These newer treatments are done using a local anaesthetic, meaning you do not feel pain in your legs during the procedure but you remain awake. What did we want to find out? We wanted to compare all the currently available treatments for varicose veins to find out which is best in terms of: ‚Äö√Ñ√™ short‚Äö√Ñ√™ and long‚Äö√Ñ√™term technical success (whether the treatment fully destroys the vein, or stops blood from pooling in the legs, or both); ‚Äö√Ñ√™ stopping varicose veins from returning (recurrence); ‚Äö√Ñ√™ avoiding unwanted effects; and ‚Äö√Ñ√™ improving people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s well‚Äö√Ñ√™being. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared treatments for varicose veins in men and women of any age. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 24 studies that involved 5135 people with mild to severe varicose veins. The studies followed people for between 5 weeks to 8 years after their treatment. The majority of the people in the studies were women.

3,CD012309.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a condition that results in the overflow of tears (epiphora) or infection of the nasolacrimal sac (dacryocystitis). The etiology of acquired NLDO is multifactorial and is not fully understood. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is the surgical correction of NLDO, which aims to establish a new drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nose. The success of DCR is variable; the most common cause of failure is fibrosis and stenosis of the surgical ostium. Antimetabolites such as mitomycin‚Äö√Ñ√™C (MMC) and 5‚Äö√Ñ√™fluorouracil (5‚Äö√Ñ√™FU) have been shown to be safe and effective in reducing fibrosis and improving clinical outcomes in other ophthalmic surgery settings (e.g. glaucoma and cornea surgery). Application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR has been studied, but the utility of these treatments remains uncertain. Objectives Primary objective:  To determine if adjuvant treatment with antimetabolites improves functional success in the setting of DCR compared to DCR alone. Secondary objectives:  To determine if anatomic success of DCR is increased with the use of antimetabolites, and if the surgical ostium is larger in participants treated with antimetabolites. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eye and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches. We last searched the electronic databases on 6 September 2019. Selection criteria We only included randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies were those that compared the administration of antimetabolites of any dose and concentration versus placebo or another active treatment in participants with NLDO undergoing primary DCR and reoperation. We only included studies that had enrolled adults 18 years or older. We also included studies that used silicone intubation as part of the DCR procedure. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies using an electronic data collection form. Main results We included 31 studies in the review, of which 23 (1309 participants) provided data relating to our primary and secondary outcomes. Many of the 23 studies evaluated functional success, while others also assessed our secondary outcomes of anatomic success or ostium size, or both. Study characteristics Participant characteristics varied across studies, with the age of participants ranging from 30 to 70 years. Participants were predominantly women. These demographics correspond to those most frequently affected by nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Almost all of the studies utilized MMC as the antimetabolite, with only one using 5‚Äö√Ñ√™FU. We assessed most trials as at unclear risk of bias for most domains. Conflicts of interest were not frequently reported, although the antimetabolites used are generic medications, and studies were not likely to be conducted for financial interest. Findings Twenty studies provided data on the primary outcome of functional success, of which 7 (356 participants) provided data at 6 months and 14 (909 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. At six months, the results showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on functional success (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.29; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Beyond six months, the results favored the antimetabolite group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Fourteen studies reported data on the secondary outcome of anatomic success, of which 4 (306 participants) reported data at 6 months and 12 (831 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. Results at six months showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on anatomic success (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Beyond six months, participants in the antimetabolite group were more likely to achieve anatomic success than those receiving DCR alone (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.15; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). At six months and beyond six months follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up, two studies reported mean change in ostium size. We did not conduct meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis for the various follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up periods due to clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. However, point estimates from these studies at six months consistently favored participants in the antimetabolite group (low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Beyond six months, while point estimates from one study favored participants in the antimetabolite group, estimates from another study showed no evidence of a difference between the two groups. The certainty of evidence at both time points was low. Adverse events Adverse events were rare. One study reported that one participant in the MMC group experienced delayed wound healing. Other studies reported no significant adverse events related to the application of antimetabolites. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence that application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR increases functional and anatomic success of DCR when patients are followed for more than six months after surgery, but no evidence of a difference at six months, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty of evidence. There is low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence that combining antimetabolite with DCR increases the size of the lacrimal ostium at six months. However, beyond six months, the evidence remain uncertain. Adverse effects of the application of antimetabolites were minimal. Plain language summary Antimetabolites as an adjunct to dacryocystorhinostomy for nasolacrimal duct obstruction What is the aim of the review?  Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a type of surgery that creates a new tear drainage pathway between the eyelid and nose to relieve tearing symptoms (functional success), improve openness of the tear duct to irrigation (anatomic success), and increase the size of the opening into the nose (ostium size). Our aim was to assess whether antiscarring medications (antimetabolites) can increase the functional success, anatomic success, and ostium size of DCR. Key results  We found that antimetabolites may improve functional and anatomic success (relative to DCR alone) at a follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up time longer than six months. Antimetabolites may also improve ostium size at six months. What was studied in the review?  The lacrimal system of the eye produces tears, which nourish the eye surface and keep it moist. After passing along the eye surface, tears drain into the nose through the lacrimal drainage apparatus. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is the blockage of this canal, which can cause an overflow of tears. NLDO is usually painless and can affect one or both eyes. NLDO can also lead to infection of the eye. NLDO is treated surgically with a procedure known as dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), which establishes a new pathway by creating a pathway between the tear sac and the nose. Antimetabolites have been used to improve success rates of this procedure. We wanted to learn whether DCR in combination with antimetabolites can improve outcomes for functional success, anatomic success, and ostium size than DCR alone. We collected and analyzed all relevant randomized controlled trials to answer this question. What are the main results of the review?  We identified 31 relevant studies for inclusion, most of which originated in South and East Asia and involved predominantly women. These studies compared participants who underwent DCR with metabolites versus participants who underwent DCR alone. Twenty‚Äö√Ñ√™three of these studies (1309 participants) provided data on our outcomes of interest. DCR with antimetabolites may improve functional and anatomic success when patients are followed more than six months after surgery; the certainty of this evidence was moderate. There was no difference in functional and anatomic success at six months among participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites compared to participants who underwent DCR alone; the certainty of evidence is low. At six months, participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites may have increased ostium size compared to those receiving DCR alone. However, beyond six months, there is no evidence of a difference between participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites compared to participants who underwent DCR alone. The certainty of the evidence was low due to substantial variability among the studies that assessed this outcome. Adverse effects of antimetabolites were minimal.

11,CD007585.PUB4,"Abstract - Background This is an update of a previous Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2010 and updated in Issue 9, 2015. The role of lymphadenectomy in surgical management of endometrial cancer remains controversial. Lymph node metastases can be found in approximately 10% of women who before surgery are thought to have cancer confined to the womb. Removal of all pelvic and para‚Äö√Ñ√™aortic lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) at initial surgery has been widely advocated, and pelvic and para‚Äö√Ñ√™aortic lymphadenectomy remains part of the FIGO (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) staging system for endometrial cancer. This recommendation is based on data from studies that suggested improvement in survival following pelvic and para‚Äö√Ñ√™aortic lymphadenectomy. However, these studies were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not confer a direct therapeutic benefit, other than allocating women to poorer prognosis groups. Furthermore, the Cochrane review and meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis of RCTs of routine adjuvant radiotherapy to treat possible lymph node metastases in women with early‚Äö√Ñ√™stage endometrial cancer found no survival advantage. Surgical removal of pelvic and para‚Äö√Ñ√™aortic lymph nodes has serious potential short‚Äö√Ñ√™term and long‚Äö√Ñ√™term sequelae. Therefore, it is important to investigate the clinical value of this treatment. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to June 2009 for the original review, updated the search to June 2015 for the last updated version and further extended the search to March 2017 for this version of the review. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria RCTs and quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™RCTs that compared lymphadenectomy versus no lymphadenectomy in adult women diagnosed with endometrial cancer . Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and progression‚Äö√Ñ√™free survival and risk ratios (RRs) comparing adverse events in women who received lymphadenectomy versus those with no lymphadenectomy were pooled in random‚Äö√Ñ√™effects meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Main results 978 unique references were identified via the search strategy. All but 50 were excluded by title and abstract screening. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria; for one small RCT, data were insufficient for inclusion in the meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis. The two RCTs included in the analysis randomly assigned 1945 women, reported HRs for survival adjusted for prognostic factors and based on 1851 women and had an overall low risk of bias, as they satisfied four of the assessment criteria. The third study had an overall unclear risk of bias, as information provided was not adequate concerning random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, or completeness of outcome reporting. Results of the meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis remained unchanged from the previous versions of this review and indicated no differences in overall and recurrence‚Äö√Ñ√™free survival between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.43; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.58 for overall and recurrence‚Äö√Ñ√™free survival, respectively) (1851 participants, two studies; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). We found no difference in risk of direct surgical morbidity between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy. However, women who underwent lymphadenectomy had a significantly higher risk of surgery‚Äö√Ñ√™related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.27; RR 8.39, 95% CI 4.06 to 17.33 for risk of surgery‚Äö√Ñ√™related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation, respectively) (1922 participants, two studies; high‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). Authors' conclusions This review found no evidence that lymphadenectomy decreases risk of death or disease recurrence compared with no lymphadenectomy in women with presumed stage I disease. Evidence on serious adverse events suggests that women who undergo lymphadenectomy are more likely to experience surgery‚Äö√Ñ√™related systemic morbidity or lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation. Currently, no RCT evidence shows the impact of lymphadenectomy in women with higher‚Äö√Ñ√™stage disease and in those at high risk of disease recurrence. Plain language summary The role of removing lymph nodes as part of standard surgery for endometrial cancer The issue  Cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrial cancer) is now the most common gynaecological cancer among women in western Europe and North America. Most of these women (75%) have tumours confined to the body of the womb at the time of diagnosis, and three‚Äö√Ñ√™quarters of women will survive for 10 years after diagnosis. Lymph node metastases can be found in one in 10 women who appear to have cancer confined to the womb at the time of diagnosis, and removal of all pelvic and para‚Äö√Ñ√™aortic lymph nodes has been advocated, even for women with presumed early‚Äö√Ñ√™stage cancer. This recommendation is based on non‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised studies that suggested improvement in survival following removal of pelvic and para‚Äö√Ñ√™aortic lymph nodes. However, treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not be beneficial, and additional treatment to lymph nodes might not necessarily be better treatment, especially as surgical removal of lymph nodes has serious potential short‚Äö√Ñ√™term and long‚Äö√Ñ√™term harmful effects. The aim of the review  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of lymphadenectomy in the management of endometrial cancer. What are the main findings?  We found only three trials that compared lymphadenectomy with no lymphadenectomy among women with endometrial cancer. One of these trials could not be included in the meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis of this review, as it provided insufficient information about outcomes for women. When we combined findings from the two remaining trials, which included 1945 women, we found no evidence that women who received lymphadenectomy were less likely to die or have a relapse of their cancer. In addition, severe adverse events experienced as a consequence of lymphadenectomy outnumbered those reported when no lymphadenectomy was performed. Quality of the evidence  The overall quality of the evidence for lymphadenectomy versus standard surgery was moderate for survival outcomes and adverse events (other than evidence for presence or absence of lymphoedema or lymphocyst, which was of high quality). The quality of evidence for quality of life was very low, as this outcome was not reported. What are the conclusions?  The uncertainty of whether lymphadenectomy or no lymphadenectomy is best in the management of early‚Äö√Ñ√™stage endometrial cancer probably reflects the fact that evidence shows no reduction in death or in disease relapse when lymphadenectomy is performed, rather than lack of evidence. In addition, women undergoing lymphadenectomy experienced more severe adverse events than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy.",Lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer,Frost and  JA; Webster and  KE; Bryant and  A; Morrison and  J,3,2,2,unclear what the other group is,3,no
12,CD002764.PUB2,"Abstract - Background This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2000. Intestinal obstruction commonly occurs in progressive advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancers. Management of these patients is difficult due to the patients' deteriorating mobility and function (performance status), the lack of further chemotherapeutic options, and the high mortality and morbidity associated with palliative surgery. There are marked variations in clinical practice concerning surgery in these patients between different countries, gynaecological oncology units and general hospitals, as well as referral patterns from oncologists under whom these patients are often admitted. Objectives To assess the efficacy of surgery for intestinal obstruction due to advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer. Search methods We searched the following databases for the original review in 2000 and again for this update in June 2015: CENTRAL (2015, Issue 6); MEDLINE (OVID June week 1 2015); and EMBASE (OVID week 24, 2015). We also searched relevant journals, bibliographic databases, conference proceedings, reference lists, grey literature and the world wide web for the original review in 2000; we also used personal contact. This searching of other resources yielded very few additional studies. The Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Review Group no longer routinely handsearch journals. For these reasons, we did not repeat the searching of other resources for the June 2015 update. Selection criteria As the review concentrates on the 'best evidence' available for the role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction in known advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer we kept the inclusion criteria broad (including both prospective and retrospective studies) so as to include all studies relevant to the question. We sought published trials reporting on the effects of surgery for resolving symptoms in malignant bowel obstruction for adult patients with known advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer. Data collection and analysis We used data extraction forms to collect data from the studies included in the review. Two review authors extracted the data independently to reduce error. Owing to concerns about the risk of bias we decided not to conduct a meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis of data and we have presented a narrative description of the study results. We planned to resolve disagreements by discussion with the third review author. Main results In total we have identified 43 studies examining 4265 participants. The original review included 938 patients from 25 studies. The updated search identified an additional 18 studies with a combined total of 3327 participants between 1997 and June 2015. The results of these studies did not change the conclusions of the original review. No firm conclusions can be drawn from the many retrospective case series so the role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction remains controversial. Clinical resolution varies from 26.7% to over 68%, though it is often unclear how this is defined. Despite being an inadequate proxy for symptom resolution or quality of life, the ability to feed orally was a popular outcome measure, with success rates ranging from 30% to 100%. Rates of re‚Äö√Ñ√™obstruction varied, ranging from 0% to 63%, though time to re‚Äö√Ñ√™obstruction was often not included. Postoperative morbidity and mortality also varied widely, although again the definition of both of these surgical outcomes differed between many of the papers. There were no data available for quality of life. The reporting of adverse effects was variable and this has been described where available. Where discussed, surgical procedures varied considerably and outcomes were not reported by specific intervention. Using the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool, most included studies were at high risk of bias for most domains. Authors' conclusions The role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction needs careful evaluation, using validated outcome measures of symptom control and quality of life scores. Further information could include re‚Äö√Ñ√™obstruction rates together with the morbidity associated with the various surgical procedures. Currently, bowel obstruction is managed empirically and there are marked variations in clinical practice by different units. In order to compare outcomes in malignant bowel obstruction, there needs to be a greater degree of standardisation of management. Since the last version of this review none of the new included studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. Plain language summary Surgery for resolving symptoms associated with malignant bowel obstruction in advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancers Background Advanced cancer causes a range of complex problems for patients. In gynaecological (for example ovarian and womb) and gastrointestinal (for example colon or bowel) cancers, the bowel can become blocked or obstructed by the original tumour, metastatic deposits or due to the side effects of previous treatments. The decision to operate on patients with bowel obstruction who are already very unwell because of their advanced cancer is difficult. Often, these people develop bowel obstruction as a sign that the cancer is progressing and they are in the process of dying. When the bowel obstructs in this situation, surgery might be useful for some patients, it might make no difference to how long the patient has to live, or it might make the situation worse due to the complications of surgery. When time is short, managing symptoms and maximising comfort for the patient is the priority. Different surgical teams adopt different approaches. We wanted to establish the evidence for the benefit and harm of surgery in these situations and therefore help patients and doctors make good decisions. Key findings and quality of the evidence We first looked at the evidence in 2000 and this is an update of the original review. In total we found 43 studies examining 4265 people. We looked at adults with advanced gynaecological or gastrointestinal cancer who developed bowel obstruction and had either surgical or non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment. The studies we found were of low quality and measured success and benefit in different ways. It was therefore not possible to compare these studies and conclude whether surgery was of benefit or harm in this situation. Research in this area is problematic and the type of study needed to answer this question would be very difficult to conduct.",Surgery for the resolution of symptoms in malignant bowel obstruction in advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer,Cousins and  SE; Tempest and  E; Feuer and  DJ,3,2,3,actually could be medical management,3,yes
14,CD008509.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Ureteral colic is a common reason for patients to seek medical care. Alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers are commonly used to improve stone passage through so‚Äö√Ñ√™called medical expulsive therapy (MET), but their effectiveness remains controversial. This is an update of a 2014 Cochrane review; since that time, several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant. Objectives To assess effects of alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers compared with standard therapy for ureteral stones 1 cm or smaller confirmed by imaging in adult patients presenting with symptoms of ureteral stone disease. Search methods On 18 November 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP to identify all published/unpublished and ongoing trials. We checked all references of included and review articles and conference proceedings for articles relevant to this review. We sent letters to investigators to request information about unpublished or incomplete studies. Selection criteria We included RCTs of ureteral stone passage in adult patients that compared alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers versus standard therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures. We performed meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis using a random‚Äö√Ñ√™effects model. Primary outcomes were stone clearance and major adverse events; secondary outcomes were stone expulsion time, number of pain episodes, use of diclofenac, hospitalisation, and surgical intervention. We assessed the quality of evidence on a per‚Äö√Ñ√™outcome basis using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 67 studies with 10,509 participants overall. Of these, 15 studies with 5787 participants used a placebo. Stone clearance: Based on the overall analysis, treatment with an alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blocker may result in a large increase in stone clearance (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 1.55; low‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). A subset of higher‚Äö√Ñ√™quality, placebo‚Äö√Ñ√™controlled trials suggest that the likely effect is probably smaller (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence), corresponding to 116 more (95% CI 51 more to 182 more) stone clearances per 1000 participants. Major adverse events: Based on the overall analysis, treatment with an alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blocker may have little effect on major adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.96; low‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). A subset of higher‚Äö√Ñ√™quality, placebo‚Äö√Ñ√™controlled trials suggest that alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers likely increase the risk of major adverse events slightly (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.86), corresponding to 29 more (95% CI 3 more to 75 more) major adverse events per 1000 participants. Patients treated with alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers may experience shorter stone expulsion times (mean difference (MD) ‚Äö√Ñ√™3.40 days, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™4.17 to ‚Äö√Ñ√™2.63; low‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence), may use less diclofenac (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√™82.41, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™122.51 to ‚Äö√Ñ√™42.31; low‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence), and likely require fewer hospitalisations (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.77; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence), corresponding to 69 fewer hospitalisations (95% CI 93 fewer to 32 fewer) per 1000 participants. Meanwhile, the need for surgical intervention appears similar (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02; low‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence), corresponding to 28 fewer surgical interventions (95% CI 51 fewer to 2 more) per 1000 participants. A predefined subgroup analysis (test for subgroup differences; P = 0.002) suggests that effects of alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers may vary with stone size, with RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.15; P = 0.16; I¬¨‚â§ = 62%) for stones 5 mm or smaller versus 1.45 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.72; P < 0.0001; I¬¨‚â§ = 59%) for stones larger than 5 mm. We found no evidence suggesting possible subgroup effects based on stone location or alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blocker type. Authors' conclusions For patients with ureteral stones, alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers likely increase stone clearance but probably also slightly increase the risk of major adverse events. Subgroup analyses suggest that alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers may be less effective for smaller (5 mm or smaller) than for larger stones (greater than 5 mm). Plain language summary Alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers for ureteral stones in adult patients with symptoms of stone disease Review question Does medical treatment with alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers improve the outcomes of patients with stones stuck in their ureter? Background Stones stuck in the ureter, which is the tube that transports urine from the kidney to the bladder, often cause pain and make people see a doctor. Depending on which part of the ureter the stone is stuck in and the size of the stone, it will often pass into the bladder on its own over the course of weeks. If the stone does not come out by itself, people often need to have procedures done to remove the stone. Alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers are medications that relax muscles in the urinary tract and may make the stone pass into the bladder faster. However, they can cause unwanted effects. We updated an existing Cochrane Review from 2014 to look into the effects of alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers. Study characteristics Based on our latest search of the literature from November 2017, we included 64 studies with 10,509 participants. Of these, 15 studies compared alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers with placebo with 5787 participants. A placebo is a pill that looks and tastes exactly like the real medication, so participants did not know what they were getting. These were the higher‚Äö√Ñ√™quality studies, which we trusted more. Key results Based on the subset of higher‚Äö√Ñ√™quality studies that used a placebo, alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers likely resulted in more people passing their stones. However, these patients are likely to experience slightly more serious unwanted effects of this medication. People taking alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers may pass their stones in a shorter time, may use less diclofenac (which is a type of pain medication), and are likely to be admitted to the hospital less often. Meanwhile, the need for surgery for their stones was similar. Upon completing additional analyses, we found that effects of alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers may be different in people with small (5 mm or smaller) versus larger (larger than 5 mm) stones. It appears that this medication works better in people with larger stones. We could find no difference in how well alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers work, no matter where in the ureter the stone is stuck or what type of alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blocker is used. Authors' conclusions For patients with stones stuck in the ureter, alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers likely make passing the stone easier but cause slightly more unwanted effects. It appears that alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers work better in people with larger (greater than 5 mm) rather than smaller (5 mm or smaller) stones. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence for most outcomes was moderate or low, meaning that we have moderate or low confidence in most of the reported results.",Alpha‚Äö√Ñ√™blockers as medical expulsive therapy for ureteral stones,Campschroer and  T; Zhu and  X; Vernooij and  RWM; Lock and  MTWT,3,2,3,the standard therapy would it be considered surgical?

15,CD013085.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction, or a combination of these with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It can result in a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options or therapies for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) is a relatively cheap option and potentially efficient way to deliver physical therapy for people with CVI. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Clinical Trials.gov trials register to August 2018. We searched the LILACS and IBECS databases. We also checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy with no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed studies retrieved by the search strategies. Both review authors independently assessed selected studies for complete analysis. We resolved conflicts through discussion. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, obtaining additional information. For binary outcomes (leg ulcer incidence and adverse events), we presented the results using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes (disease severity, health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life (HRQoL), pain, oedema, skin pigmentation), we presented the results as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Main results We included seven randomised controlled trials with 891 participants (outpatients in secondary care). We found no quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised controlled trials. Six studies (836 participants) evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment. One study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug ( melilotus officinalis ) (55 participants). There was a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, imprecision and inconsistency, which downgraded the certainty of the evidence. For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison, there probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptom score as assessed using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√¨1.66, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√¨4.14 to 0.83; 2 studies, 484 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably resulted in a moderate improvement in HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CVIQ2) at three months (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√¨9.38, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√¨18.18 to ‚Äö√Ñ√¨0.57; 2 studies, 149 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), nine months (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√¨10.46, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√¨11.81 to ‚Äö√Ñ√¨9.11; 1 study; 55 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), and 12 months (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√¨4.99, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√¨9.19 to ‚Äö√Ñ√¨0.78; 2 studies, 455 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in HRQoL between balneotherapy and no treatment at six months (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√¨1.64, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√¨9.18 to 5.89; 2 studies, 445 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably slightly improved pain compared with no treatment (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√¨1.23, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√¨1.33 to ‚Äö√Ñ√¨1.13; 1 study; 390 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). There was no clear effect related to oedema between the two groups at 24 days (MD 43.28 mL, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√¨102.74 to 189.30; 2 studies, 153 participants; very‚Äö√Ñ√™low certainty evidence). There probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in the incidence of leg ulcers (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.48; 2 studies, 449 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). There was probably a reduction in incidence of skin pigmentation changes in favour of balneotherapy at 12 months (pigmentation index: MD ‚Äö√Ñ√¨3.59, 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√¨4.02 to ‚Äö√Ñ√¨3.16; 1 study; 59 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). The main complications reported included erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), thromboembolic events (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study; 59 participants; low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), with no clear evidence of an increase in reported adverse effects with balneotherapy. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies. For the balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug ( melilotus officinalis ) comparison, we observed no clear difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study; 35 participants; very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence) and oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study; 35 participants; very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). This single study did not report on the other outcomes of interest. Authors' conclusions We identified moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™ to low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence that suggests that balneotherapy may result in a moderate improvement in pain, quality of life and skin pigmentation changes and has no clear effect on disease severity signs and symptoms score, adverse effects, leg ulcers and oedema when compared with no treatment. For future studies, measurements of outcomes such as disease severity sign and symptom score, quality of life, pain and oedema and choice of time points during follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up must be standardised for adequate comparison between trials. Plain language summary Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) Background Chronic venous insufficiency is a disease caused by abnormal transport of blood into the veins of the lower limbs, which means the veins cannot pump enough blood back to the heart. This condition is defined by several signs, with gnarled and enlarged veins being the most common and venous ulcers being the most severe. There is a wide variety of management options or therapies for chronic venous insufficiency, ranging from surgery and medicine, to compression (applying force) and physical therapies. Balneotherapy is a possible way to deliver physical therapy for people with chronic venous insufficiency. Balneotherapy is a traditional medical technique that involves water and is usually practiced in spas. It consists of the immersion in mineral water or mud loaded with minerals. It may or may not include exercise. Alone or combined with usual care, balneotherapy may provide a significant improvement in the quality of life of people with chronic venous insufficiency when compared with usual care alone. Study characteristics We identified seven randomised controlled trials (studies in which the participants were divided between treatment groups through random method) (most recent search August 2018). Six studies compared balneotherapy versus no treatment, and one study compared balneotherapy versus a medicine called  melilotus officinalis . The studies used different types of balneotherapy and different treatment times. Key results and certainty of the evidence For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison there probably is no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptoms score (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably improves health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life and pain (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). There probably is no improvement in favour of balneotherapy for leg ulcers (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). There is no clear effect related to oedema (swelling caused when fluid leaks out of the body's tiny blood vessels) between balneotherapy and no treatment (very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably reduces skin pigmentation changes (low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). None of the studies reported any serious adverse events. There were fewer side effects (infection and blood clots in the legs) in people receiving balneotherapy compared to no treatment. When comparing balneotherapy with  melilotus officinalis , there were insufficient data to detect clear differences between the two treatments for pain and oedema in the single small study. There were no data available for the other outcomes of interest such as disease severity signs and symptoms score, quality of life, leg ulcers and skin pigmentation. The certainty of the evidence was affected by the small number of trials with few participants and the impossibility of blinding of participants and physicians conducting the balneotherapy treatment, which could have led to bias.",Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency,de Moraes Silva and  MA; Nakano and  LCU; Cisneros and  LL; Miranda Jr and  F,3,2,2,,3,yes
16,CD006087.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach. Objectives The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013),  meta Register of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random‚Äö√Ñ√™effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors. Main results Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF‚Äö√ë¬¢ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient‚Äö√Ñ√™oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post‚Äö√Ñ√™operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post‚Äö√Ñ√™operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0%). Similarly, no difference in post‚Äö√Ñ√™operative infection between the use of two 3‚Äö√Ñ√™dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events. Authors' conclusions This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances. Plain language summary Treatments for fractures of the lower jaw Review question The lower jaw (also known as the mandible) is an important bone that shapes the face, holds the lower teeth in place and is used to move the mouth, for talking and chewing food. Fractures are most often found in the part of the lower jaw that supports teeth (known as the body), the part where the jaw curves upwards into the neck (the angle), or at the knobbly‚Äö√Ñ√™shaped joint found at the very top of the jaw bone (the condyle). Available treatments align and stabilize the fracture, allowing the bone to heal in the proper position. Treatments may or may not involve surgery. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines different methods for treating fractures of the body and angle of the mandible in existing research and studies. Background People of all ages can fracture their lower jaw, but fractures mainly occur as a result of violence (for example, being hit or punched in the jaw) or by being involved in an accident on the road (for example, car crashes or bicycle accidents). These fractures can be stabilized by physically binding the jaw shut with a system of bars, wires or elastic bands (intermaxillary fixation), or by using tiny screws or plates attached directly to the fractured sections of the lower jaw bone whilst still allowing the mouth to open (rigid fixation). Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery. Key results There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well‚Äö√Ñ√™conducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.",Interventions for the management of mandibular fractures,Nasser and  M; Pandis and  N; Fleming and  PS; Fedorowicz and  Z; Ellis and  E; Ali and  K,3,2,3,closed interesting,3,no
21,CD006134.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Functional ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. When large, persistent, or painful, these cysts may require operations, sometimes resulting in removal of the ovary. Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s. Objectives This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts. Search methods In March 2014, we searched the databases of CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, and POPLINE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We also examined the reference lists of articles. For the initial review, we wrote to authors of identified trials to seek articles we had missed. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials in any language that included oral contraceptives used for treatment and not prevention of functional ovarian cysts. Criteria for diagnosis of cysts were those used by authors of trials. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently abstracted data from the articles. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy of data entry. For dichotomous outcomes, we computed the Mantel‚Äö√Ñ√™Haenszel odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference with 95% CI. Main results We identified eight randomized controlled trials from four countries; the studies included a total of 686 women. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives did not hasten resolution of functional ovarian cysts in any trial. This held true for cysts that occurred spontaneously as well as those that developed after ovulation induction. Most cysts resolved without treatment within a few cycles; persistent cysts tended to be pathological (e.g., endometrioma or para‚Äö√Ñ√™ovarian cyst) and not physiological. Authors' conclusions Although widely used for treating functional ovarian cysts, combined oral contraceptives appear to be of no benefit. Watchful waiting for two or three cycles is appropriate. Should cysts persist, surgical management is often indicated. Plain language summary Oral contraceptives to treat cysts of the ovary Women of reproductive age usually release an egg about once a month. The ovary gets an egg from the inside of the ovary to its surface by creating a blister or fluid‚Äö√Ñ√™filled space around the developing egg. When the blister (or cyst) reaches the surface of the ovary, it bursts and releases the egg into the abdominal cavity. After this occurs, the blister can develop into another type of cyst, which makes a hormone (progesterone) that helps the pregnancy to grow. Most of these cysts come and go without problems. Sometimes, however, the cysts get large or painful; others may remain for months. Several decades ago, health care providers learned that women taking birth control pills had fewer cysts, since the pills usually kept an egg from being released. Based on this fact, many clinicians started treating these cysts with birth control pills to make them go away faster. In March 2014, we did a computer search for all randomized controlled trials that studied use of birth control pills to treat these benign (also called functional) cysts. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We found eight trials from four countries; they included 686 women. Three trials included women receiving drugs to help them get pregnant. The other five included women who developed cysts without fertility treatment. In none of these trials did oral contraceptives help the cysts go away faster. Thus, birth control pills should not be used for this purpose. A better approach is waiting two or three months for the cysts to go away on their own.",Oral contraceptives for functional ovarian cysts,Grimes and  DA; Jones and  LB; Lopez and  LM; Schulz and  KF,3,2,2,,3,yes
24,CD000434.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Fracture of the proximal humerus, often termed shoulder fracture, is a common injury in older people. The management of these fractures varies widely. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2012. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of treatment and rehabilitation interventions for proximal humeral fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases, conference proceedings and bibliographies of trial reports. The full search ended in November 2014. Selection criteria We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised controlled trials pertinent to the management of proximal humeral fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis Both review authors performed independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Only limited meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis was performed. Main results We included 31 heterogeneous RCTs (1941 participants). Most of the 18 separate treatment comparisons were tested by small single‚Äö√Ñ√™centre trials. The main exception was the surgical versus non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment comparison tested by eight trials. Except for a large multicentre trial, bias in these trials could not be ruled out. The quality of the evidence was either low or very low for all comparisons except the largest comparison. Nine trials evaluated non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment in mainly minimally displaced fractures. Four trials compared early (usually one week) versus delayed (three or four weeks) mobilisation after fracture but only limited pooling was possible and most of the data were from one trial (86 participants). This found some evidence that early mobilisation resulted in better recovery and less pain in people with mainly minimally displaced fractures. There was evidence of little difference between the two groups in shoulder complications (2/127 early mobilisation versus 3/132 delayed mobilisation; 4 trials) and fracture displacement and non‚Äö√Ñ√™union (2/52 versus 1/54; 2 trials). One quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised trial (28 participants) found the Gilchrist‚Äö√Ñ√™type sling was generally more comfortable than the Desault‚Äö√Ñ√™type sling (body bandage). One trial (48 participants) testing pulsed electromagnetic high‚Äö√Ñ√™frequency energy provided no evidence. Two trials (62 participants) provided evidence indicating little difference in outcome between instruction for home exercises versus supervised physiotherapy. One trial (48 participants) reported, without presentable data, that home exercise alone gave better early and comparable long‚Äö√Ñ√™term results than supervised exercise in a swimming pool plus home exercise. Eight trials, involving 567 older participants, evaluated surgical intervention for displaced fractures. There was high quality evidence of no clinically important difference in patient‚Äö√Ñ√™reported shoulder and upper‚Äö√Ñ√™limb function at one‚Äö√Ñ√™ or two‚Äö√Ñ√™year follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up between surgical (primarily locking plate fixation or hemiarthroplasty) and non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment (sling immobilisation) for the majority of displaced proximal humeral fractures; and moderate quality evidence of no clinically important difference between the two groups in quality of life at two years (and at interim follow‚Äö√Ñ√™ups at six and 12 months). There was moderate quality evidence of little difference between groups in mortality in the surgery group (17/248 versus 12/248; risk ratio (RR) 1.40 favouring non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 2.83; P = 0.35; 6 trials); only one death was explicitly linked with the treatment. There was moderate quality evidence of a higher risk of additional surgery in the surgery group (34/262 versus 16/261; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.60; P = 0.01; 7 trials). Although there was moderate evidence of a higher risk of adverse events after surgery, the 95% confidence intervals for adverse events also included the potential for a greater risk of adverse events after non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment. Different methods of surgical management were tested in 12 trials. One trial (57 participants) comparing two types of locking plate versus a locking nail for treating two‚Äö√Ñ√™part surgical neck fractures found some evidence of slightly better function after plate fixation but also of a higher rate of surgically‚Äö√Ñ√™related complications. One trial (61 participants) comparing a locking plate versus minimally invasive fixation with distally inserted intramedullary K‚Äö√Ñ√™wires found little difference between the two implants at two years. Compared with hemiarthroplasty, one trial (32 participants) found similar results with locking plate fixation in function and re‚Äö√Ñ√™operation rates, whereas another trial (30 participants) reported all five re‚Äö√Ñ√™operations occurred in the tension‚Äö√Ñ√™band fixation group. One trial (62 participants) found better patient‚Äö√Ñ√™rated (Quick DASH) and composite shoulder function scores at a minimum of two years follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up and a lower incidence of re‚Äö√Ñ√™operation and complications after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) compared with hemiarthroplasty. No important between‚Äö√Ñ√™group differences were found in one trial (120 participants) comparing the deltoid‚Äö√Ñ√™split approach versus deltopectoral approach for non‚Äö√Ñ√™contact bridging plate fixation, and two trials (180 participants) comparing 'polyaxial' and 'monaxial' screws in locking plate fixation. One trial (68 participants) produced some preliminary evidence that tended to support the use of medial support locking screws in locking plate fixation. One trial (54 participants) found fewer adverse events, including re‚Äö√Ñ√™operations, for the newer of two types of intramedullary nail. One trial (35 participants) found better functional results for one of two types of hemiarthroplasty. One trial (45 participants) found no important effects of tenodesis of the long head of the biceps for people undergoing hemiarthroplasty. Very limited evidence suggested similar outcomes from early versus later mobilisation after either surgical fixation (one trial: 64 participants) or hemiarthroplasty (one trial: 49 participants). Authors' conclusions There is high or moderate quality evidence that, compared with non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment, surgery does not result in a better outcome at one and two years after injury for people with displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the humeral neck and is likely to result in a greater need for subsequent surgery. The evidence does not cover the treatment of two‚Äö√Ñ√™part tuberosity fractures, fractures in young people, high energy trauma, nor the less common fractures such as fracture dislocations and head splitting fractures. There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to inform the choices between different non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical, surgical, or rehabilitation interventions for these fractures. Plain language summary Interventions for treating shoulder fractures in adults Background Fracture of the top end of the upper arm bone (proximal humerus) is a common injury in older people. It is often called a shoulder fracture. The bone typically fractures (breaks) just below the shoulder, usually after a fall. Most of these fractures occur without breaking the skin lying over the fracture. The injured arm is often supported in a sling until the fracture heals sufficiently to allow shoulder movement. More severe (displaced) fractures may be treated surgically. This may involve fixing the fracture fragments together by various means. Alternatively, the top of the fractured bone may be replaced (half 'shoulder' replacement: hemiarthroplasty). More rarely, the whole joint, thus including the joint socket, is replaced (total 'shoulder' replacement). Physiotherapy is often used to help restore function. Results of the search We searched medical databases up to November 2014 and included 31 randomised studies with a total of 1941 participants. Most of the 18 treatment comparisons were tested by one study only. The best evidence was from eight studies, one of which was a relatively large multicentre study; these investigated whether surgery gave a better result than non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment for displaced fractures. Key results Nine trials evaluated non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment in usually less severe fractures. One trial found a type of arm sling was generally more comfortable than a type of body bandage. There was some evidence that early mobilisation (within one week), compared with delayed mobilisation (after three weeks), resulted in less pain and faster recovery in people with 'stable' fractures. Two studies provided weak evidence that many patients could generally achieve a satisfactory outcome when given sufficient instruction to pursue exercises on their own. Eight studies, involving 567 participants with displaced fractures, compared surgical versus non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment. Pooled results from the five most recent trials showed that there were no important differences between the two approaches for patient‚Äö√Ñ√™reported measures of function and quality of life at 6, 12 and 24 months. There was little difference between the two groups in mortality. Twice as many surgical group patients had additional or secondary surgery. More surgical group patients had adverse events. Twelve trials (744 participants) tested different methods of surgical treatment. There was weak evidence of some differences (e.g. in complications) between some interventions (e.g. different devices or different ways of using devices). There was very limited evidence suggesting similar outcomes for early versus delayed mobilisation after either surgical fixation or hemiarthroplasty. Quality of the evidence Most of the 31 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered that the evidence was either of high or moderate quality for the results of the surgical versus non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment comparison, which means that we are pretty certain",Interventions for treating proximal humeral fractures in adults,Handoll and  HHG; Brorson and  S,3,3,3,so unclear whether surgery is compared head to head but it says all interventions‚Ä¶,3,no
25,CD003278.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Winging of the scapula is caused by weakness of the thoracoscapular muscles, which allows the scapula to lift off the chest wall during shoulder movements. In facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (and occasionally in other muscular dystrophies) there is selective weakness of the thoracoscapular muscles which may spare other shoulder muscles such as the deltoid muscle. This imbalance results in significant winging and loss of shoulder function. Historically, a number of different surgical and non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical interventions have been used to achieve scapular stability. This review examines the evidence available for the use of all scapular fixation techniques in muscular dystrophy, especially facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Objectives To examine the evidence for the relative efficacy of scapular fixation techniques in muscular dystrophy (especially facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy) in improving upper limb function. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (20 July 2009), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2009) Medline (1966 to July 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2009) for randomised trials. We also contacted authors of trials and other experts in the field. Selection criteria All reports of scapular fixation for muscular dystrophy, including quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised or randomised controlled trials, comparing any form of scapular fixation (surgical and non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical) in people (of all ages and of all severity) with scapular winging due to muscular dystrophy. Our primary outcome measure was objective improvement in shoulder abduction. Our secondary outcome measures were: patient‚Äö√Ñ√™perceived improvement in performance of activities of daily living, cosmetic results, subjective improvement in pain and proportion of patients with significant postoperative complications. Data collection and analysis We collated and summarised studies on the treatment of scapular winging in muscular dystrophy. Main results No randomised trials were identified. We therefore present a review of the non‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised literature available. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the suggestion from observational studies that operative interventions produce significant benefits. However, these have to be balanced against postoperative immobilisation, need for physiotherapy and potential complications. We conclude that a randomised trial would be difficult, but a register of cases and the use of a standardised assessment protocol would allow more accurate comparison of the disparate techniques. Plain language summary Surgical operations for winging of the shoulder blade in muscular dystrophy Winging of the scapula (shoulder blade) in muscular dystrophy is caused by weakness of the muscles which attach the scapula to the chest and help raise the arms. Non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical interventions involve casts or slings to support the shoulders. Surgical operations involve fixing the scapulae to the ribs using screws or wire. No randomised controlled trials were found. Small case series suggest that surgical operations might produce significant benefits in some people. These need to be balanced against loss of mobility, need for physiotherapy and possible complications including failure of the fixing material or reduced breathing capacity.",Scapular fixation in muscular dystrophy,Orrell and  RW; Copeland and  S; Rose and  MR,3,3,3,surgical and non surgical non surgical are mainly casts‚Ä¶,3,no
28,CD008717.PUB3,"Abstract - Background The liver is affected by two of the most common groups of malignant tumours: primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma or other extrahepatic primary cancers. Liver metastases are significantly more common than primary liver cancer, and the reported long‚Äö√Ñ√™term survival rate after radical surgical treatment is approximately 50%. However, R0 resection (resection for cure) is not feasible in the majority of patients; therefore, other treatments have to be considered. One of these is percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), which causes dehydration and necrosis of tumour cells, accompanied by small‚Äö√Ñ√™vessel thrombosis, leading to tumour ischaemia and destruction of the tumour. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in people with liver metastases. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 10 September 2019: the Cochrane Hepato‚Äö√Ñ√™Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; Science Citation Index Expanded; Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Science; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We also searched clinical trials registers such as ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (17 September 2019) . Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection and its comparators (no intervention, other ablation methods, systemic treatments) for liver metastases. Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures as outlined by Cochrane. We extracted information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, study design, and trial methods. Two review authors performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using GRADE. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Main results We identified only one randomised clinical trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection (PEI) in addition to transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) versus TACE alone. The trial was conducted in China and included 48 trial participants with liver metastases: 25 received PEI plus TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. The trial included 37 male and 11 female participants. Mean participant age was 49.3 years. Sites of primary tumours included colon (27 cases), stomach (12 cases), pancreas (3 cases), lung (3 cases), breast (2 cases), and ovary (1 case). Seven participants had a single tumour, 15 had two tumours, and 26 had three or more tumours in the liver. The bulk diameter of the tumour on average was 3.9 cm, ranging from 1.2 cm to 7.6 cm. Participants were followed for 10 months to 43 months. The trial reported survival data after one, two, and three years. In the PEI + TACE group, 92%, 80%, and 64% of participants survived after one year, two years, and three years; in the TACE alone group, these percentages were 78.3%, 65.2%, and 47.8%, respectively. Upon conversion of these data to mortality rates, the calculated risk ratio (RR) for mortality at last follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up when PEI plus TACE was compared with TACE alone was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.33; very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence) after three years of follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up. Local recurrence was 16% in the PEI plus TACE group and 39.1% in the TACE group, resulting in an RR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.15; very low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Forty‚Äö√Ñ√™five out of a total of 68 tumours (66.2%) shrunk by at least 25% in the PEI plus TACE group versus 31 out of a total of 64 tumours (48.4%) in the TACE group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but provided very few details. We did not find data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. The single included trial did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effectiveness of PEI plus TACE versus TACE in people with liver metastases is of very low certainty and is based on one small randomised clinical trial at high risk of bias. Currently, it cannot be determined whether adding PEI to TACE makes a difference in comparison to using TACE alone. Evidence for benefits or harms of PEI compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments is lacking. Plain language summary Percutaneous ethanol injection for liver metastases Is local destruction of the cancer that spread to the liver with percutaneous ethanol injection beneficial? Review question What is the effect of using percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) to destroy any cancer metastases in the liver? Metastases are new cancer sites that are found in parts of the body other than the site of the original cancer. We were looking for any randomised trial (a study in which patients are allocated to groups by a play of chance) assessing effects of PEI in people with metastases in the liver from cancer of any location compared with no PEI with or without co‚Äö√Ñ√™interventions. We looked at effects of PEI on risk of death, progression of disease, health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life, and adverse events (unwanted effects caused by the intervention). Background When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites of metastasis is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancers affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die of complications. Metastases in the liver can be destroyed by several different methods, one of them being PEI. This procedure is performed under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance; a special needle is placed at the cancer site and is subsequently used to inject alcohol with the goal of killing cancer tissues. Ultrasound and computed tomography are imaging procedures. Alcohol induces tumour destruction by drawing water out of tumour cells (dehydrating them), thereby altering (denaturing) the structure of the cellular proteins. Search results and study characteristics We last searched for evidence on 10 September 2019. We included only one randomised trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE; a liver‚Äö√Ñ√™directed treatment whereby chemotherapy is administered through the catheter directly to blood vessels supplying the tumour) to TACE alone. Forty‚Äö√Ñ√™eight people with liver metastases were included; 25 received PEI with TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. Primary tumours were colon, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, and ovary cancers. The included study did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Key results Results of one small randomised clinical trial do not show beneficial or harmful effects of adding percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection to TACE in people with liver metastases with respect to mortality or local recurrence in comparison with TACE alone. Participants were followed for between 10 and 43 months. The tumour necrosis was larger in the combined treatment group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but gave very few details. We found no data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. Quality of evidence We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty because the identified study was at high risk of bias, had a relatively small sample size, described few events overall, and reported inconclusive results.",Percutaneous ethanol injection for liver metastases,Swierz and  MJ; Storman and  D; Riemsma and  RP; Wolff and  R; Mitus and  JW; Pedziwiatr and  M; Kleijnen and  J; Bala and  MM,3,2,3,other ablation methods makes me a bit sceptical as ablation may or may not be seen as surgical what do you think?,3,no
29,CD006212.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Pulmonary emboli (PE), or blood clots in the lungs,can be potentially fatal. Anticoagulation is the first line therapy to prevent PE. In some instances anticoagulation fails to prevent more emboli, or cannot be given because the person has a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena caval filters (VCFs) are metal alloy devices that mechanically trap fragmented emboli from the deep leg veins en route to the pulmonary circulation. Retrievable filters are designed to be introduced and removed percutaneously. Although their deployment seems of theoretical benefit, their clinical efficacy and adverse event profile is unclear. This is the third update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007. Objectives To assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of vena caval filters (VCFs) in preventing pulmonary embolism (PE). Search methods For this review update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (last searched 10 September 2019) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2019, Issue 8) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online. The CIS also searched MEDLINE Ovid, EMBASE Ovid, CINAHL, and AMED (1 January 2017 to 10 September 2019) and trials registries to 10 September 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that examined the efficacy of VCFs in preventing PE. Data collection and analysis For this update, studies were assessed and data extracted independently. We assessed study quality with Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. The outcomes of interest were PE, mortality, lower limb venous thrombosis, filter‚Äö√Ñ√™related complications and major bleeding. Main results We identified four new studies for this update, bringing the total to six included studies involving 1388 participants. The six studies were clinically heterogeneous and we were unable to carry out meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis. Only two studies were considered to be both applicable in current clinical settings and of good methodological quality. One was a randomised open‚Äö√Ñ√™label trial studying the effect of a retrievable inferior vena caval filter plus anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone on risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) in 399 participants over three months. There was no evidence of a difference in the rates of PE, death, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or bleeding at three and six months after the intervention (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). A filter was inserted in 193 people, but could only be successfully retrieved from 153. Minor filter complications were noted at six months. The second clinically relevant study was a randomised open‚Äö√Ñ√™label trial of 240 participants who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries, allocated to a filter or no filter, three days after injury, in conjunction with anticoagulation and intermittent pneumatic compression. Prophylactic anticoagulation was initiated in both groups when it was thought safe to do so. There was no evidence of a difference in symptomatic PE, death, or lower limb venous thrombosis rates (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). The only major filter complication was that one person required surgical removal of the filter. We are unable to draw any conclusions from the remaining four included studies. One study showed an increased incidence of long‚Äö√Ñ√™term lower extremity DVT at eight years. Three studies are no longer clinically applicable because they utilised permanent filters which are seldom used now, or they did not use routine prophylactic anticoagulation which is current standard practice. The fourth study compared two filter types and was terminated prematurely as one filter group had a higher rate of thrombosis compared to the other filter type. Authors' conclusions Two of the six identified studies were relevant for current clinical settings. One showed no evidence of a benefit of retrievable filters in acute PE for the outcomes of PE, death, DVT and bleeding during the initial three months in people who can receive anticoagulation (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). The other study did not show any benefit for prophylactic filter insertion in people who sustained multiple traumatic injuries, with respect to symptomatic PE, mortality, or lower extremity venous thrombosis (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). We can draw no firm conclusions regarding filter efficacy in the prevention of PE from the remaining four RCTs identified in this review. Further trials are needed to assess vena caval filter effectiveness and safety, and clinical differences between various filter types. Plain language summary Vena caval filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism Background Blood clots in the lungs are called pulmonary emboli. They commonly originate in the leg or pelvic veins, where they can fragment and travel to the lungs via the inferior vena cava (IVC, large vein which carries blood from the lower body to the heart). Further emboli are usually prevented by blood thinning medications (anticoagulants). In some instances (approximately 4% of cases), anticoagulation fails, or it is too dangerous to give anticoagulation. Vena caval filters are metal alloy devices inserted within the IVC to trap blood clots. Modern filters are 'retrievable,' allowing their removal once they are no longer required. However, a number of retrievable filters are not removed. The long‚Äö√Ñ√™term safety profile of these devices is not known. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of vena caval filters. The review authors looked for studies comparing filters with no filter, and studies comparing different filter designs. Study characteristics and key results We included six trials with a total of 1388 participants in the review (current until 10 September 2019). There were too many differences between these studies so we could not combine the results. Two trials were applicable in current clinical settings. One trial showed there is no clear benefit in receiving a retrievable filter for the first three months after an acute PE, for those who can receive anticoagulation, in terms of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), death or bleeding. Not all filters could be removed. Only minor complications from the filters were noted at six months. Another study of people who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries did not show any benefit of inserting a filter three days after injury to prevent PE, or reduce deaths. Preventive anticoagulation and calf compression devices were administered to participants when possible. We are unable to draw any conclusions from the remaining four included studies. This is because three studies are no longer clinically relevant because they utilised permanent filters which are seldom used now, or they did not use routine preventative anticoagulation which is current standard practice. One study showed an increased rate of lower‚Äö√Ñ√™extremity DVT in the permanent filter group. The fourth study compared two filter types and was stopped prematurely and thus did not generate sufficient data. Reliability of the evidence Two studies were relevant in current clinical contexts. The evidence presented by both of these studies is of moderate certainty. We reached this assessment because we were not able to combine the data from the studies, and because of the low numbers of participants and events involved. The studies differed in type of participants and clinical situations. There is a further need for trials evaluating the effectiveness of caval filters in people who cannot receive anticoagulation, or when PE occurs despite adequate anticoagulation.",Vena caval filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism,Young and  T; Sriram and  KB,3,2,2,,3,no
32,CD011650.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is classified in many ways. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group staging classifies the cancer based on patient's life expectancy. People with very early‚Äö√Ñ√™ or early‚Äö√Ñ√™stage hepatocellular carcinoma have single tumour or three tumours of maximum diameter of 3 cm or less, Child‚Äö√Ñ√™Pugh status A to B, and performance status 0 (fully functional). Management of hepatocellular carcinoma is uncertain. Objectives To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of early or very early hepatocellular carcinoma through a network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis and instead assessed the benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other or versus sham or no intervention using standard Cochrane methodology. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on hepatocellular carcinoma. Selection criteria We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with very early‚Äö√Ñ√™ or early‚Äö√Ñ√™stage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, size and number of the tumours, and future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials including participants who were previously liver transplanted. We considered interventions compared with each other, sham, or no intervention. Data collection and analysis We calculated the odds ratio, mean difference, rate ratio, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both fixed‚Äö√Ñ√™effect and random‚Äö√Ñ√™effects models based on available‚Äö√Ñ√™participant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed the risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four trials (593 participants; 574 participants included for one or more analyses) compared surgery versus radiofrequency ablation in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, eligible to undergo surgery. Fourteen trials (2533 participants; 2494 participants included for various analyses) compared different non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical interventions in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, not eligible to undergo surgery. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes for both comparisons. Surgery versus radiofrequency ablation The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral aetiology. The trials did not report the participants' portal hypertension status or whether they received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. The average follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up ranged from 29 months to 42 months (3 trials). There was no evidence of a difference in all‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality at maximal follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up for surgery versus radiofrequency ablation (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.08; 574 participants; 4 trials; I 2  = 68). Cancer‚Äö√Ñ√™related mortality was lower in the surgery group (20/115 (17.4%)) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (43/115 (37.4%)) (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65; 230 participants; 1 trial). Serious adverse events (number of participants) was higher in the surgery group (14/60 (23.3%)) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (1/60 (1.7%)) (odds ratio 17.96, 95% CI 2.28 to 141.60; 120 participants; 1 trial). The number of serious adverse events was higher in the surgery group (adjusted rate 11.3 events per 100 participants) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (3/186 (1.6 events per 100 participants)) (rate ratio 7.02, 95% CI 2.29 to 21.46; 391 participants; 2 trials; I 2  = 0%). None of the trials reported health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life. One trial was funded by a party with vested interests; three trials were funded by parties without any vested. Non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical interventions The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral aetiology. Most trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants, and none of the trials reported whether the participants received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. The average follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up ranged from 6 months to 37 months (11 trials). Trial participants, who were not eligible for surgery, were treated with radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation, microwave ablation, percutaneous acetic acid injection, percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of radiofrequency ablation with systemic chemotherapy, a combination of radiofrequency ablation with percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation with percutaneous alcohol injection, or a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation with radiofrequency ablation. The mortality at maximal follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up was higher in the percutaneous acetic acid injection (hazard ratio 1.77, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.79; 125 participants; 1 trial) and percutaneous alcohol injection (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.88; 882 participants; 5 trials; I 2  = 57%) groups compared with the radiofrequency ablation group. There was no evidence of a difference in all‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality at maximal follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up for any of the other comparisons. The proportion of people with cancer‚Äö√Ñ√™related mortality at maximal follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up was higher in the percutaneous alcohol injection group (adjusted proportion 16.8%) compared with the radiofrequency ablation group (20/232 (8.6%)) (odds ratio 2.18, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.89; 458 participants; 3 trials; I 2  = 0%). There was no evidence of a difference in any of the comparisons that reported serious adverse events (number of participants or number of events). None of the trials reported health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life. Five trials were funded by parties without any vested interest; the source of funding was not available in the remaining trials. Authors' conclusions The evidence was of low or very low quality. There was no evidence of a difference in all‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality at maximal follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up between surgery and radiofrequency ablation in people eligible for surgery. All‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality at maximal follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up was higher with percutaneous acetic acid injection and percutaneous alcohol injection than with radiofrequency ablation in people not eligible for surgery. There was no evidence of a difference in all‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality at maximal follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up for the other comparisons. High‚Äö√Ñ√™quality RCTs designed to assess clinically important differences in all‚Äö√Ñ√™cause mortality and health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life, and having an adequate follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up period (approximately five years) are needed. Plain language summary Treatment of very early‚Äö√Ñ√™ or early‚Äö√Ñ√™stage primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) arises from the liver cells and is distinct from cancer arising from other parts of the body and spreading to the liver. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group staging classifies cancer based on patient's life expectancy. It is broadly based on the size of the cancer, number of cancers in the liver, how well the liver functions, and whether one's activities are affected by the cancer. People with very early‚Äö√Ñ√™ or early‚Äö√Ñ√™stage hepatocellular carcinoma have single cancer or multiple small cancers confined to the liver, have good liver function, and no restriction of activities. There is significant uncertainty in the management of early‚Äö√Ñ√™stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we searched literature databases for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on the topic until September 2016. We excluded trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time, we planned to use advanced methods described in full in the review. Study characteristics of included trials Four trials (593 participants; 574 participants included for one or more analyses) compared surgery (removal of part of the liver containing cancer) versus radiofrequency ablation (cancer destruction using heat generated by electric current) in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, eligible to undergo surgery; and 14 trials (2533 participants; 2494 participants included for various analyses) compared different non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical interventions in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, not eligible to undergo surgery. Key results Surgery versus radiofrequency ablation The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral cause. The trials did not report the participants' portal hypertension status or whether they received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. Three trials reported average follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up (range 29 months to 42 months). One trial was funded by a party with vested interests; three trials were funded by parties without any vested.. In people eligible for surgery, there was no evidence of a difference in death between radiofrequency ablation and surgery; although there were fewer deaths due to cancer in the surgery group. There were more serious complications in the the surgery group than in the radiofrequency ablation group. None of the trials reported health‚Äö√Ñ√™related quality of life. Non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical interventions The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral cause.

33,CD001081.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long‚Äö√Ñ√™term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of a Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2017. Objectives To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone, in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non‚Äö√Ñ√™disabling stroke). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal to October 2019. We also reviewed the reference lists of all relevant studies and abstract books from research proceedings. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carotid artery surgery plus best medical treatment with best medical treatment alone.  Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. We assessed the results and the quality of the evidence of the primary and secondary outcomes by the GRADE method, which classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. Main results We included three trials involving 6343 participants. The trials differed in the methods of measuring carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke. Using the primary electronic data files, we pooled and analysed individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient‚Äö√Ñ√™years of follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials, and redefining outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. Surgery increased the five‚Äö√Ñ√™year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with less than 30% stenosis (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.56; 2 studies, 1746 participants; high‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). Surgery decreased the five‚Äö√Ñ√™year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19; 2 studies, 1429 participants; high‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94; 3 studies, 1549 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near‚Äö√Ñ√™occlusion (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.67; 3 studies, 1095 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). However, surgery decreased the five‚Äö√Ñ√™year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with near‚Äö√Ñ√™occlusions (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.53; 2 studies, 271 participants; moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of recurrent stroke for people with significant stenosis. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence) and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis (moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). Plain language summary Carotid surgery in people who have symptoms with narrowing of the carotid artery Question What are the benefits of surgical removal of the fatty deposits and blood clots from inside the carotid artery wall (carotid endarterectomy) for people who have recently (within four to six months) had symptoms due to carotid stenosis (narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to the brain)? Background Strokes cause long‚Äö√Ñ√™term disability and death. The chances of dying from the first stroke are 15% to 35%, and increase to 69% in subsequent strokes, which often occur within one year of the first attack. Carotid endarterectomy may reduce the risk of subsequent or recurrent stroke, but carries a risk of complications immediately before, after, and during the operation, including disabling stroke and death. There is a 7% risk of stroke and death within 30 days of endarterectomy. Search date We searched for studies to 23 October 2019. Study characteristics This review identified three randomised controlled trials (6343 participants randomised), which compared carotid surgery with no carotid surgery (i.e. best medical therapy plus surgery versus best medical therapy alone) in participants with carotid stenosis and recent transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), or minor ischaemic strokes in the territory of that artery. The trials were carried out in centres in Europe, USA, Canada, Israel, South Africa, and Australia. The gender ratio of participants was 2.6:1 (72% men and 28% women); 90% of participants were younger than 75 years old. The results of the three trials were initially conflicting, because they differed in how they measured carotid stenosis and how they defined the outcomes. To address this discrepancy, we reassessed the original patient data using the same methods and definitions, so results could be compared. Key results Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of further stroke for people with significant stenosis. Results were particularly striking for older people, male participants, those with a significant stenosis (70% to 99%), and those who were operated on within two weeks of their TIA or stroke. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% stenosis. We did not find any benefit of carotid surgery for those in whom the stenosis was minor (less than 50%) or where the carotid artery was almost blocked (near occlusion). Quality of the evidence The evidence was of moderate or high quality for all the results. Therefore, we can be moderately or very confident in the results.",Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis,Rerkasem and  A; Orrapin and  S; Howard and  DPJ; Rerkasem and  K,3,2,3,best medical management,3,yes
34,CD010244.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer. Resection of the cancer is the only treatment with the potential to achieve long‚Äö√Ñ√™term survival. However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving adjacent structures such as blood vessels which are not usually removed because of fear of increased complications after surgery. Such patients often receive palliative treatment. Resection of the pancreas along with the involved vessels is an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus palliative treatment in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trial registers until February 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing pancreatic resection versus palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (irrespective of language or publication status). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed‚Äö√Ñ√™effect and random‚Äö√Ñ√™effects models using Review Manager (RevMan). We calculated the hazard ratio (HR), risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on an intention‚Äö√Ñ√™to‚Äö√Ñ√™treat analysis. Main results We identified two trials comparing pancreatic resection versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Ninety eight patients were randomised to pancreatic resection (n = 47) or palliative treatment (n = 51) in the two trials included in this review. Both trials were at high risk of bias. Both trials included patients who had locally advanced pancreatic cancer which involved the serosa anteriorly or retroperitoneum posteriorly or involved the blood vessels. Such pancreatic cancers would be considered generally unresectable. One trial included patients with pancreatic cancer in different locations of the pancreas including the head, neck and body (n = 42). The patients allocated to the pancreatic resection group underwent partial pancreatic resection (pancreatoduodenectomy with lymph node clearance or distal pancreatic resection with lymph node clearance) in this trial; the control group received palliative treatment with chemoradiotherapy. In the other trial, only patients with cancer in the head or neck of the pancreas were included (n = 56). The patients allocated to the pancreatic resection group underwent en bloc total pancreatectomy with splenectomy and vascular reconstruction in this trial; the control group underwent palliative bypass surgery with chemoimmunotherapy. The pancreatic resection group had lower mortality than the palliative treatment group (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58, very low quality evidence). Both trials followed the survivors up to at least five years. There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group in either trial. Approximately 40% of the patients who underwent pancreatic resection were alive in the pancreatic resection group at the end of three years. This difference in survival was statistically significant (RR 22.68; 95% CI 3.15 to 163.22). The difference persisted at five years of follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up (RR 8.65; 95% CI 1.12 to 66.89). Neither trial reported severe adverse events but it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from severe adverse events in both groups. The overall peri‚Äö√Ñ√™operative mortality in the resection group in the two trials was 2.5%. None of the trials reported quality of life. The estimated difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of the patient related to the treatment) between the two groups was imprecise (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√™23.00 days; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™59.05 to 13.05, very low quality evidence). The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the pancreatic resection group than the palliative treatment group (MD ‚Äö√Ñ√™10.70 thousand USD; 95% CI ‚Äö√Ñ√™14.11 to ‚Äö√Ñ√™7.29, very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is very low quality evidence that pancreatic resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and venous involvement. When sufficient expertise is available, pancreatic resection could be considered for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased morbidity associated with the procedure. Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to increase confidence in the estimate of effect and to assess the quality of life of patients and the cost‚Äö√Ñ√™effectiveness of pancreatic resection versus palliative treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Plain language summary Surgical removal of part of the pancreas and other tissues versus other treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer which invades the surrounding structures Background The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen which secretes digestive juices for the digestion of food. It also harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain the blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer. Surgery to remove the cancer improves survival. However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving major blood vessels which are not usually removed because of the fear of increased complications after surgery. Such patients receive palliative treatment. Resection (removing part of an organ) of the pancreas has been suggested as an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, in this group of patients the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus other treatments are not clear. We set out to answer this question by performing a thorough search of the literature for studies which compared surgical removal with palliative treatments. We included only randomised controlled trials, studies which, if designed appropriately, can help avoid arriving at wrong conclusions. We searched the literature for all studies reported until December 2013. Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data to minimise errors. Characteristics of studies We identified two trials comparing surgical removal of the pancreas versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Ninety eight patients were included in these two trials. Forty seven patients received surgery while the remaining patients received palliative treatment. The choice of who received surgery and who received other treatments was decided by a method similar to the toss of a fair coin. Main results Approximately 97% of patients who underwent cancer removal surgery survived the surgery in the two trials. The patients who received surgery were twice as likely to live as those who received other treatments. The survivors were followed until at least five years. There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group while approximately 40% of the patients who underwent surgical removal were alive at the end of three years. This difference in survival was statistically significant. The studies did not report the complications related to surgery although it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from complications in both groups. None of the trials reported quality of life. There was no evidence of any difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of a patient related to the treatment) between the two groups. The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the surgical removal group (by about USD 10,000) than in the palliative treatment group in the trial conducted in Japan. There was no information about the costs in the other trial, which was conducted in Greece. Quality of evidence Overall, the trials were at high risk of bias (that is, there is a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions). This was because it was not clear how the randomisation was performed, whether the people assessing the outcomes were aware of the group to which the participants belonged, and whether all participants were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was very low as the trials were at high risk of bias and there were few trials to assess whether only studies with negative results were published. Conclusions There is very low quality evidence that surgical resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with involvement of veins. In selected patients pancreatic resection could be considered for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased complications associated with the surgical procedure and when sufficient expertise is available. Future research Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to obtain more precise results and to assess the quality of life of patients and the value for money of surgical removal versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.",Resection versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer,Gurusamy and  KS; Kumar and  S; Davidson and  BR; Fusai and  G,3,3,3,,3,yes
37,CD010517.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of ≈í‚â§‚Äö√Ñ√™thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life‚Äö√Ñ√™long blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with ≈í‚â§‚Äö√Ñ√™thalassaemia major or intermedia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018). Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled and quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio‚Äö√Ñ√™frequency). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post‚Äö√Ñ√™operative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra‚Äö√Ñ√™operative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low‚Äö√Ñ√™quality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post‚Äö√Ñ√™operative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03). Authors' conclusions The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long‚Äö√Ñ√™term effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well‚Äö√Ñ√™conducted observational studies may be used to answer this question. Plain language summary Removal of the spleen in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia Review question We reviewed the evidence comparing the removal of the spleen (splenectomy) to other treatments (such as blood transfusions and chelation (removal of excess iron) in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia. Background Thalassaemia is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in production of haemoglobin ‚Äö√Ñ√™ which carries oxygen in red blood cells to all the tissues of the body. The clinical presentation of thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form to being dependant on life long blood transfusions. The genetic defect in thalassaemia also results in formation of ineffective red blood cells, which are removed by the spleen which in turn becomes enlarged. Removing the spleen can lengthen the lifespan of red blood cells and reduce the need for transfusions. We wanted to evaluate whether current evidence showed that removing the spleen was safe and effective in the long term and compare different surgical methods of removing the spleen. Search date The evidence is current to: 02 August 2019. Study characteristics One study with a total of 28 participant was included in the review. This study compared two methods of splenectomy ‚Äö√Ñ√™ laparoscopic (keyhole) versus an open surgical approach. Study participants were recruited over a period of 3.5 years, but participants were only followed up to the end of their hospital stay (usually less than one week). Key results The study evaluated the two types of surgical methods. Only one of our three primary outcomes were reported, the number of people experiencing major adverse events (bleeding during and after the operation and complete or partial collapse of a lung). However, the amount of information available is not sufficient to draw any reliable conclusions (very‚Äö√Ñ√™low quality evidence). Hence, we were unable to provide recommendations regarding the use of splenectomy in people with thalassaemia.

40,CD012602.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks‚Äö√Ñ√¥ gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. An estimated 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Miscarriage can lead to serious morbidity, including haemorrhage, infection, and even death, particularly in settings without adequate healthcare provision. Early miscarriages occur during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and can be managed expectantly, medically or surgically. However, there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and risks of each option. Objectives To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different management methods for early miscarriage, and to provide rankings of the available methods according to their effectiveness, safety, and side‚Äö√Ñ√™effect profile using a network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Trials Register (9 February 2021),  ClinicalTrials.gov  and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (12 February 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of methods for miscarriage management. Early miscarriage was defined as less than or equal to 14 weeks of gestation, and included missed and incomplete miscarriage. Management of late miscarriages after 14 weeks of gestation (often referred to as intrauterine fetal deaths) was not eligible for inclusion in the review. Cluster‚Äö√Ñ√™ and quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded non‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised trials. Data collection and analysis At least three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for the primary outcomes of complete miscarriage and composite outcome of death or serious complications. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Relative effects for the primary outcomes are reported subgrouped by the type of miscarriage (incomplete and missed miscarriage). We also performed pairwise meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analyses and network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available methods. Main results Our network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis included 78 randomised trials involving 17,795 women from 37 countries. Most trials (71/78) were conducted in hospital settings and included women with missed or incomplete miscarriage. Across 158 trial arms, the following methods were used: 51 trial arms (33%) used misoprostol; 50 (32%) used suction aspiration; 26 (16%) used expectant management or placebo; 17 (11%) used dilatation and curettage; 11 (6%) used mifepristone plus misoprostol; and three (2%) used suction aspiration plus cervical preparation. Of these 78 studies, 71 (90%) contributed data in a usable form for meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis. Complete miscarriage Based on the relative effects from the network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis of 59 trials (12,591 women), we found that five methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for achieving a complete miscarriage: ¬¨‚àë suction aspiration after cervical preparation (risk ratio (RR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.20, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), ¬¨‚àë dilatation and curettage (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), ¬¨‚àë suction aspiration (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.62, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), ¬¨‚àë mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.66, moderate‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), ¬¨‚àë misoprostol (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). The highest ranked surgical method was suction aspiration after cervical preparation. The highest ranked non‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical treatment was mifepristone plus misoprostol. All surgical methods were ranked higher than medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Composite outcome of death and serious complications Based on the relative effects from the network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis of 35 trials (8161 women), we found that four methods with available data were compatible with a wide range of treatment effects compared with expectant management or placebo: ¬¨‚àë dilatation and curettage (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.06, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), ¬¨‚àë suction aspiration (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.32, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), ¬¨‚àë misoprostol (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.15, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence), ¬¨‚àë mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.84, low‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence). Importantly, no deaths were reported in these studies, thus this composite outcome was entirely composed of serious complications, including blood transfusions, uterine perforations, hysterectomies, and intensive care unit admissions. Expectant management and placebo ranked the lowest when compared with alternative treatment interventions. Subgroup analyses by type of miscarriage (missed or incomplete) agreed with the overall analysis in that surgical methods were the most effective treatment, followed by medical methods and then expectant management or placebo, but there are possible subgroup differences in the effectiveness of the available methods.  Authors' conclusions Based on relative effects from the network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis, all surgical and medical methods for managing a miscarriage may be more effective than expectant management or placebo. Surgical methods were ranked highest for managing a miscarriage, followed by medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Expectant management or placebo had the highest chance of serious complications, including the need for unplanned or emergency surgery. A subgroup analysis showed that surgical and medical methods may be more beneficial in women with missed miscarriage compared to women with incomplete miscarriage. Since type of miscarriage (missed and incomplete) appears to be a source of inconsistency and heterogeneity within these data, we acknowledge that the main network meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis may be unreliable. However, we plan to explore this further in future updates and consider the primary analysis as separate networks for missed and incomplete miscarriage.  Plain language summary Which management option is best when women experience an early miscarriage? What is the issue? Miscarriage is the most common cause of pregnancy loss and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% of pregnancies will end in miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Miscarriage can lead to serious complications, including haemorrhage and infection, and even death, particularly in low‚Äö√Ñ√™income countries. Miscarriage is generally defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks‚Äö√Ñ√¥ gestation. Most miscarriages happen in the first 14 weeks, and are known as early miscarriages. Why is this important? Miscarriage can be managed expectantly (waiting for the pregnancy tissue to pass naturally), medically (tablets given to make the womb expel the pregnancy tissue) or surgically (removal of the pregnancy tissue during surgery). However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side effects of the available methods for managing a miscarriage. The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out which method is the most effective and safest with the least side effects. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence in February 2021 and identified 78 studies involving 17,795 women. Most women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with missed (also called silent miscarriage where no pregnancy tissue has been expelled and there is no bleeding or pain) or incomplete miscarriage (already started to bleed or have pain and perhaps expelled some pregnancy tissue). We found evidence for six different methods of managing a miscarriage; three surgical methods (suction aspiration plus cervical preparation, dilatation and curettage, or suction aspiration), two medical methods (mifepristone plus misoprostol or misoprostol alone), and expectant management or placebo. The analysis suggested that all three surgical methods and both medical methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for completing the process of miscarriage. Suction aspiration plus cervical preparation was the best method of miscarriage management followed by dilatation and curettage, and suction aspiration alone. The two medical methods of mifepristone combined with misoprostol, and misoprostol alone were ranked fourth and fifth best methods, respectively. From the available data, we cannot learn much for the outcome of death or serious complications. No deaths were reported in the studies that contributed towards this outcome. Amongst the serious complications, the majority were women who required blood transfusions, some had womb perforations related to surgery or required further life‚Äö√Ñ√™saving procedures. We could not know which method is best for this outcome due to limited data. However, expectant management or placebo was associated with more serious complications compared with the alternative treatment options. We also looked separately at women suffering from an incomplete miscarriage compared to those suffering from a missed miscarriage. For both groups of women, all three surgical methods and both medical methods were found to be more effective than expectant management or placebo for providing a definitive treatment for a miscarriage. These analyses for incomplete and missed miscarriages agreed with the overall analysis in that surgical methods were better for providing a definitive treatment for a miscarriage than medical methods, which in turn were better than expectant management or placebo.

Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage, although the effect is uncertain. This is an update of a review first published in 2009 and previously updated in 2010. Objectives To assess the effects of decompressive surgery on nerve damage in leprosy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (15 October 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 9 in  The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2012), AMED (January 1985 to October 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to October 2012) and LILACS (from January 1982 to October 2012). We checked reference lists of the studies identified, the Current Controlled Trials Register (www.controlled‚Äö√Ñ√™trials.com) (1 November 2012), conference proceedings and contacted trial authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™RCTs of decompressive surgery for nerve damage in leprosy. Data collection and analysis The primary outcome was improvement in sensory and motor nerve function after one year. Secondary outcomes were improvement in nerve function after two years, change in nerve pain and tenderness, and adverse events. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials and non‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised studies. Main results We included two RCTs involving 88 participants. The trials were at high risk of bias. The trials examined the added benefit of surgery over prednisolone for treatment of nerve damage of less than six months duration. After two years' follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up there was only very low quality evidence of no significant difference in nerve function improvement between participants treated with surgery plus prednisolone or with prednisolone alone. Adverse effects of decompressive surgery were not adequately described. Authors' conclusions Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage in leprosy but the available evidence from RCTs is of very low quality and does not show a significant added benefit of surgery over steroid treatment alone.

42,CD009590.PUB2,"Abstract - Background This overview reports on interventions for pain relief and for subfertility in pre‚Äö√Ñ√™menopausal women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis. Objectives The objective of this overview was to summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on treatment options for women with pain or subfertility associated with endometriosis. Methods Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting pain or fertility outcomes in women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis were eligible for inclusion in the overview. We also identified Cochrane reviews in preparation (protocols and titles) for future inclusion. The reviews, protocols and titles were identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in March 2014. Pain‚Äö√Ñ√™related outcomes of the overview were pain relief, clinical improvement or resolution and pain recurrence. Fertility‚Äö√Ñ√™related outcomes were live birth, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage and adverse events. Selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE methods. Review findings were summarised in the text and the data for each outcome were reported in 'Additional tables'. Main results Seventeen systematic reviews published in  The Cochrane Library  were included. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. Limitations in the evidence included risk of bias in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies, and imprecision in effect estimates. Pain relief (14 reviews) Gonadotrophin‚Äö√Ñ√™releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues One systematic review reported low quality evidence of an overall benefit for GnRH analogues compared with placebo or no treatment. Ovulation suppression Five systematic reviews reported on medical treatment using ovulation suppression. There was moderate quality evidence that the levonorgestrel‚Äö√Ñ√™releasing intrauterine system (LNG‚Äö√Ñ√™IUD) was more effective than expectant management, and very low quality evidence that danazol was more effective than placebo. There was no consistent evidence of a difference in effectiveness between oral contraceptives and goserelin, estrogen plus progestogen and placebo, or progestogens and placebo, though in all cases the relevant evidence was of low or very low quality. Non‚Äö√Ñ√™steroidal anti‚Äö√Ñ√™inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) A review of NSAIDs reported inconclusive evidence of a benefit in symptom relief compared with placebo. Surgical interventions There were two reviews of surgical interventions. One reported moderate quality evidence of a benefit in pain relief following laparoscopic surgery compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only. The other reported very low quality evidence that recurrence rates of endometriomata were lower after excisional surgery than after ablative surgery. Post‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical medical interventions Two reviews reported on post‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical medical interventions. Neither found evidence of an effect on pain outcomes, though in both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine There were two systematic reviews of alternative medicine. One reported evidence of a benefit from auricular acupuncture compared to Chinese herbal medicine, and the other reported no evidence of a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and danazol. In both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Anti‚Äö√Ñ√™TNF‚Äö√Ñ√™≈í¬± drugs One review found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between anti‚Äö√Ñ√™TNF‚Äö√Ñ√™≈í¬± drugs and placebo. However, the evidence was of low quality. Reviews reporting fertility outcomes (8 reviews) Medical interventions Four reviews reported on medical interventions for improving fertility in women with endometriosis. One compared three months of GnRH agonists with a control in women undergoing assisted reproduction and found very low quality evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancies in the treatment group. There was no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between the interventions in the other three reviews, which compared GnRH agonists versus antagonists, ovulation suppression versus placebo or no treatment, and pre‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical medical therapy versus surgery alone. In all cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Surgical interventions Three reviews reported on surgical interventions. There was moderate quality evidence that both live births or ongoing pregnancy rates and clinical pregnancy rates were higher after laparoscopic surgery than after diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was low quality evidence of no difference in effectiveness between surgery and expectant management for endometrioma. One review found low quality evidence that excisional surgery resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates than drainage or ablation of endometriomata. Post‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical interventions Two reviews reported on post‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical medical interventions. They found no evidence of an effect on clinical pregnancy rates. The evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine A  review of Chinese herbal medicine in comparison with gestrinone found no evidence of a difference between the groups in clinical pregnancy rates. However, the evidence was of low quality. Adverse events Reviews of GnRH analogues and of danazol reported that the interventions were associated with higher rates of adverse effects than placebo; and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates of adverse events than other treatments. Chinese herbal medicine was associated with fewer side effects than gestrinone or danazol. Three reviews reported miscarriage as an outcome. No difference was found between surgical and diagnostic laparoscopy, between GnRH agonists and antagonists, or between aspiration of endometrioma and expectant management. However, in all cases the quality of the evidence was of low quality. Authors' conclusions For women with pain and endometriosis, suppression of menstrual cycles with gonadotrophin‚Äö√Ñ√™releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, the levonorgestrel‚Äö√Ñ√™releasing intrauterine system (LNG‚Äö√Ñ√™IUD) and danazol were beneficial interventions. Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis and excision of endometriomata were also associated with improvements in pain. The evidence on NSAIDs was inconclusive. There was no evidence of benefit with post‚Äö√Ñ√™surgical medical treatment. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence on harms was scanty, but GnRH analogues, danazol and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates than other interventions. Plain language summary Endometriosis: an overview of Cochrane Reviews Background Cochrane review authors examined the evidence on endometriosis from Cochrane systematic reviews published in  The Cochrane Library . We aimed to summarise the evidence on treatment options that are available to women with pain or subfertility, or both, associated with clinically diagnosed endometriosis. Study characteristics We included 17 Cochrane systematic reviews. Fourteen reported measures of pain relief and eight reported fertility outcomes. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons and outcomes ranged from very low to moderate, due to limitations in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies and imprecision in the findings. Key results A number of interventions appeared effective in alleviating pain in women with endometriosis. These were gonadotrophin‚Äö√Ñ√™releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues when compared with placebo, the levonorgestrel‚Äö√Ñ√™releasing intrauterine system (LNG‚Äö√Ñ√™IUD) compared with expectant management, danazol compared with placebo, and progestagens and anti‚Äö√Ñ√™progestagens compared with placebo. Laparoscopic surgical interventions also appeared to be effective for pain. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates.

43,CD005953.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The EC/IC Bypass Study Group found no benefit of extracranial to intracranial (EC/IC) bypass surgery over medical therapy in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion (sCAO). However, the study was criticised for many reasons and the real effect of this treatment is still not known conclusively. Objectives To determine whether bypass surgery plus medical care is superior to medical care alone in patients with sCAO. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2009). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2009). We also searched ongoing trials and research registers, checked reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted colleagues, trial authors and researchers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and non‚Äö√Ñ√™random studies of EC/IC bypass surgery plus best medical treatment compared with best medical treatment alone to prevent subsequent stroke, improve cerebral haemodynamics and reduce dependency after stroke. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, and extracted data items on the number of outcome events onto a data extraction form. We only analysed secondary outcomes if the study provided information on at least one primary outcome. We also used intention‚Äö√Ñ√™to‚Äö√Ñ√™treat analysis where possible. Main results We included 21 trials, including two RCTs, involving 2591 patients. For all endpoints, no benefit of EC/IC bypass surgery was shown either in the RCTs (any death: odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05, P = 0.11; stroke: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23, P = 0.91; death and dependency: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21, P = 0.64), or in the non‚Äö√Ñ√™RCTs (any death: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.62, P = 0.99; stroke: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.18, P = 0.25; death and dependency: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29, P = 0.37). Authors' conclusions EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with sCAO disease was neither superior nor inferior to medical care alone. However, most studies included patients irrespective of their cerebral haemodynamics. Participation in an ongoing RCT, which is restricted to patients with impaired haemodynamics, is recommended as these patients might benefit from bypass surgery.

In this review, we included 21 trials (two randomised controlled trials and 19 non‚Äö√Ñ√™random studies, with a total of 2591 patients). We found that EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease was no better or worse than medical care alone.

44,CD005320.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Dislocation following hip replacement is associated with significant morbidity and functional cost. The cause is usually multifactorial. A variety of treatment options are available which can broadly be classified into operative and non‚Äö√Ñ√™operative. Objectives To determine the best methods of treatment of recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement. Search methods The following databases were searched until August 2006: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Health Technology Assessment database (HTA), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), and MetaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised trials comparing operative and non‚Äö√Ñ√™operative treatments for recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement. Data collection and analysis Two independent reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to identified studies. Main results Searches identified 269 studies. None fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions The authors invite researchers to perform RCTs comparing different treatment options for recurrent dislocation of the hip. The heterogeneity of the population and variety of underlying causes would favour a multi‚Äö√Ñ√™centre study to achieve an adequate sample size. Plain language summary Treatments for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of treatments for dislocation of the hip after total hip replacement surgery. The review shows that: It is not known what the best treatment for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery is. This is because no evidence was found that looked at the treatments for dislocation of the hip after surgery. What are the treatments for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery?   In total hip replacement surgery, the whole hip joint can be replaced by an artificial joint or hip. About 3 out of 100 people who have this surgery will dislocate their hip. Dislocating a hip causes much pain and other problems. There are many ways to fix a dislocated hip. Usually, the first time a dislocation occurs the hip is put into a cast or brace. But repeated dislocations usually need to be fixed with surgery. Unfortunately, the causes for dislocation are many and some are not known making it difficult to know the best way to fix it.

45,CD010349.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Patients with newly diagnosed high‚Äö√Ñ√™risk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL) still have a poor outcome, despite multi‚Äö√Ñ√™modality intensive therapy. This poor outcome necessitates the search for new therapies, such as treatment with  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™meta‚Äö√Ñ√™iodobenzylguanidine ( 131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG). Objectives To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1945 to 25 April 2016) and Embase (Ovid) (1980 to 25 April 2016). In addition, we handsearched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We also assessed the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology, Advances in Neuroblastoma Research and the American Society of Clinical Oncology; all from 2010 up to and including 2015. We scanned the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Register (www.isrctn.com) and the National Institutes of Health Register for ongoing trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) on 13 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), non‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised single‚Äö√Ñ√™arm trials with historical controls and cohort studies examining the efficacy of  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG therapy in 10 or more patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results We identified two eligible cohort studies including 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. All studies had methodological limitations, with regard to both internal (risk of bias) and external validity. As the studies were not comparable with regard to prognostic factors and treatment (and often used different outcome definitions), pooling of results was not possible. In one study, the objective response rate (ORR) was 73% after surgery; the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 7 to 23); five‚Äö√Ñ√™year overall survival was 14.6%; median event‚Äö√Ñ√™free survival was 10 months (95% CI 7 to 13); and five‚Äö√Ñ√™year event‚Äö√Ñ√™free survival was 12.2%. In the other study, the ORR was 56% after myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation; 10‚Äö√Ñ√™year overall survival was 6.25%; and event‚Äö√Ñ√™free survival was not reported. With regard to short‚Äö√Ñ√™term adverse effects, one study showed a prevalence of 2% (95% CI 0% to 13%; best‚Äö√Ñ√™case scenario) for death due to myelosuppression. After the first cycle of  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG therapy in one study, platelet toxicity occurred in 38% (95% CI 18% to 61%), neutrophil toxicity in 50% (95% CI 28% to 72%) and haemoglobin toxicity in 69% (95% CI 44% to 86%); after the second cycle this was 60% (95% CI 36% to 80%) for platelets and neutrophils and 53% (95% CI 30% to 75%) for haemoglobin. In one study, the prevalence of hepatic toxicity during or within four weeks after last the MIBG treatment was 0% (95% CI 0% to 9%; best‚Äö√Ñ√™case scenario). Neither study reported cardiovascular toxicity and sialoadenitis. One study assessed long‚Äö√Ñ√™term adverse events in some of the children: there was elevated plasma thyroid‚Äö√Ñ√™stimulating hormone in 45% (95% CI 27% to 65%) of children; in all children, free T4 was within the age‚Äö√Ñ√™related normal range (0%, 95% CI 0% to 15%). There were no secondary malignancies observed (0%, 95% CI 0% to 9%), but only five children survived more than four years. Authors' conclusions We identified no RCTs or CCTs comparing the effectiveness of treatment including  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG therapy versus treatment not including  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. We found two small observational studies including chilren. They had high risk of bias, and not all relevant outcome results were available. Based on the currently available evidence, we cannot make recommendations for the use of  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL in clinical practice. More high‚Äö√Ñ√™quality research is needed. Plain language summary Iodine‚Äö√Ñ√™131‚Äö√Ñ√™meta‚Äö√Ñ√™iodobenzylguanidine therapy for patients with newly diagnosed high‚Äö√Ñ√™risk neuroblastoma Review question We reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness and side effects of  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™meta‚Äö√Ñ√™iodobenzylguanidine ( 131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG) therapy in patients with newly diagnosed high‚Äö√Ñ√™risk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL). Background NBL is a rare solid cancer that develops from special nerves cells. Patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL have a poor outcome, despite intensive treatments such as high‚Äö√Ñ√™dose chemotherapy to kill the cancer and surgery. This poor outcome needs research to look for new therapies, such as treatment with  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG, which is a type of targeted radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer without causing too much damage to surrounding area). Study characteristics The evidence is current to April 2016. We found two cohort studies (where a group of people (the cohort) is followed over time, to examine different treatments received and subsequent outcomes) looking at  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG treatment in 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Key results The studies were not comparable with regard to the children, the ways they were treated and the ways the different outcomes were defined and so it was impossible to combine the results in an analysis. Not all relevant outcome results were available. The percentages of children whose cancer reduced or disappeared after treatment (response rate) were 56% and 73% in the two studies, but survival was still poor: overall survival (length of time that the child remained alive) was about 15 months, event‚Äö√Ñ√™free survival (time during which there were no objective signs of tumor recurrence) was about 10 months. Overall survival five years after treatment was 14.6%, and after 10 years was 12.2%. With regard to short‚Äö√Ñ√™term side effects, there were some low blood cell counts. There was no liver toxicity. The studies did not report on heart problems and infections of the salivary glands. One study assessed long‚Äö√Ñ√™term side effects in some of the children: there was some evidence of thyroid (a gland in the neck) problems, which was brief in three children, but remained high in seven children, of whom five were prescribed medicine. There were no secondary cancers (where a different type of cancer has returned following the original cancer). Based on the currently available evidence, we cannot make recommendations for the use of  131 I‚Äö√Ñ√™MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL in clinical practice. More high‚Äö√Ñ√™quality research is needed before definite conclusions can be made.

51,CD011478.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with 528,000 estimated new cases globally in 2012. A large majority (around 85%) of the disease burden occurs in low‚Äö√Ñ√™ and middle‚Äö√Ñ√™income countries (LMICs), where it accounts for almost 12% of all female cancers. Treatment of stage IB2 cervical cancers, which sit between early and advanced disease, is controversial. Some centres prefer to treat these cancers by radical hysterectomy, with chemoradiotherapy reserved for those at high risk of recurrence. In the UK, we treat stage IB2 cervical cancers mainly with chemoradiotherapy, based on the rationale that a high percentage will have risk factors necessitating chemoradiotherapy postsurgery. There has been no systematic review to determine the best possible evidence in managing these cancers. Objectives To determine if primary surgery for stage IB2 cervical cancer (type II or type III radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy) improves survival compared to primary chemoradiotherapy. To determine if primary surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, for stage IB2 cervical cancer increases patient morbidity in the management of stage IB2 cervical cancer compared to primary chemoradiotherapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to April week 2, 2018) and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2018 week 16). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies up to April 2018. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™RCTs or non‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised studies (NRSs) comparing surgery to chemoradiotherapy in stage IB2 cervical cancers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, abstracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We identified 4968 records from the literature searches, but we did not identify any RCTs that compared primary surgery with chemoradiotherapy in stage IB2 cervical cancer. We found one NRS comparing surgery to chemoradiotherapy in IB2 and IIA2 cervical cancers which met the inclusion criteria. However, we were unable to obtain data for stage IB2 cancers only and considered the findings very uncertain due to a high risk of selection bias. Authors' conclusions There is an absence of high‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence on the relative benefits and harms of primary radical hysterectomy versus primary chemoradiotherapy for stage IB2 cervical cancer. More research is needed on the different treatment options in stage IB2 cervical cancer, particularly with respect to survival, adverse effects, and quality of life to facilitate informed decision‚Äö√Ñ√™making and individualised care. Plain language summary Surgery or chemoradiotherapy for stage IB2 cervical cancer The issue  Treatment of cervical cancers that are larger than 4 cm still thought to be confined to the cervix (classified as stage IB2 cervical cancer) is controversial. Some clinicians believe that a combination of radiotherapy (high‚Äö√Ñ√™energy rays) and chemotherapy (anti‚Äö√Ñ√™cancer drugs), together known as chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation, is better when the tumours are larger than 4 cm. This is based on the argument that the chance of the cancer returning after surgery is high, therefore most women will need chemoradiotherapy, even if they have surgery initially. The other school of thought is that these tumours are so large that they do not respond well to chemoradiotherapy and women with this stage of cervical cancer would benefit from surgery despite being at high risk of needing chemoradiotherapy after surgery. However, there are concerns about toxicity and complications related to the use of both surgery and chemoradiotherapy in women with cervical cancer, as receiving both treatments can increase morbidity. Therefore, many centres have moved towards providing only chemoradiotherapy. As there remains uncertainty about which treatment (surgery or chemoradiotherapy) is better for women with stage IB2 cervical cancer, we conducted this systematic review to try and answer this question.  How we conducted the review  We searched for evidence that compared chemoradiotherapy to surgery (type II or type III radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy) from 1946 to April 2018. We searched for both randomised controlled trials (where people taking part are put into groups at random) and non‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised studies (in which a defined group of people (the cohort) are followed over time).  What we found  We only found one non‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised study that compared surgery with chemoradiotherapy, but this study combined data on stages IB2 to IIA. Although it met the inclusion criteria, we could not analyse the data as we could not extract data specific to stage IB2 cervical cancers, therefore we considered the findings of this study to be uncertain with respect to our review question.  Conclusions  At present, there is no high‚Äö√Ñ√™certainty evidence to inform us of which of the current treatment options (chemoradiotherapy or radical surgery) is better for stage IB2 cervical cancer. Women with stage IB2 cervical cancer should be counselled regarding this uncertainty and potential side effects, and the choice of treatment should take into account the availability of the treatments in a particular health resource and patient preference. Ideally, a large multicentred trial is needed to determine which of the two treatments are better for treating women with stage IB2 cervical cancer. However, because of the relative rarity of stage 1B2 cancer, and the potential complications resulting from combining surgery and chemoradiotherapy, clinicians might continue to treat most women with chemoradiotherapy, and trials in this field might not be feasible.",Type II or type III radical hysterectomy compared to chemoradiotherapy as a primary intervention for stage IB2 cervical cancer,Nama and  V; Angelopoulos and  G; Twigg and  J; Murdoch and  JB; Bailey and  J; Lawrie and  TA,3,2,3,chemo+radio what do we think do we exclude???,3,yes
52,CD002116.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Faecal incontinence (leakage of bowel motions or stool) is a common symptom which causes significant distress and reduces quality of life. Objectives To assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of faecal incontinence. In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of Trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 June 2012) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‚Äö√Ñ√™randomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. Main results Sixteen trials were identified, including 558 participants. Eleven trials were of cross‚Äö√Ñ√™over design. Eleven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea, following ileoanal pouch or rectal surgery, or due to use of a weight‚Äö√Ñ√™reducing drug). Two trials were amongst people with weak anal sphincters, one in participants with faecal impaction and bypass leakage, and one in geriatric patients. In one trial there was no specific cause for faecal incontinence. Seven trials tested anti‚Äö√Ñ√™diarrhoeal drugs to reduce faecal incontinence and other bowel symptoms (loperamide, diphenoxylate plus atropine, and codeine). Six trials tested drugs that enhance anal sphincter function (phenylepinephrine gel and sodium valproate). Two trials evaluated osmotic laxatives (lactulose) for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with constipation in geriatric patients. One trial assessed the use of zinc‚Äö√Ñ√™aluminium ointment for faecal incontinence. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified. There was limited evidence that antidiarrhoeal drugs and drugs that enhance anal sphincter tone may reduce faecal incontinence in patients with liquid stools. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects (such as constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and nausea) than placebo. However, the dose may be titrated to the patient's symptoms to minimise side effects while achieving continence. The drugs acting on the sphincter sometimes resulted in local dermatitis, abdominal pain or nausea. Laxative use in geriatric patients reduced faecal soiling and the need for help from nurses. Zinc‚Äö√Ñ√™aluminium ointment was associated with improved quality of life, with no reported adverse effects. However, the observed improvement in quality of life was seen in the placebo group as well as the treatment group. It should be noted that all the included trials in this review had small sample sizes and short duration of follow‚Äö√Ñ√™up. 'Risk of bias' assessment was unclear for most of the domains as there was insufficient information. There were no data suitable for meta‚Äö√Ñ√™analysis. Authors' conclusions The small number of trials identified for this review assessed several different drugs in a variety of patient populations. The focus of most of the included trials was on the treatment of diarrhoea, rather than faecal incontinence. There is little evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of drug therapies for faecal incontinence. Larger, well‚Äö√Ñ√™designed controlled trials, which use the recommendations and principles set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required. Plain language summary Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults Faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements or leakage of stool or faeces) is a common healthcare problem, affecting up to one in 10 of adults living at home. This affects daily activities in about one or two in 100 people. It is more common in people living in residential care. Leakage of urine often occurs as well. Faecal incontinence can be debilitating and embarrassing. Treatments include pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, surgery and drugs. This review looked at drugs for the treatment of faecal incontinence. These included anti‚Äö√Ñ√™diarrhoea drugs or laxatives to regulate stools, and drugs to try to enhance the tone of muscle around the anus which help to keep it closed. Sixteen small trials were found, including 558 participants. The review of these trials found some evidence that anti‚Äö√Ñ√™diarrhoea drugs may reduce faecal incontinence for people having liquid stools. However, these drugs were associated with some side effects. There was some evidence that drugs to enhance the tone of the muscle around the anus may help, but more research is needed.",Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults,Omar and  MI; Alexander and  CE,3,2,3,,3,yes
