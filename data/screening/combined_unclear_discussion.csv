CD013278.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Nonsteroidal anti‚Äêinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to prevent or treat a PDA. There are concerns regarding adverse effects of NSAIDs in preterm infants. Controversy exists on whether early targeted treatment of a hemodynamically significant (hs) PDA improves clinical outcomes. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of early treatment strategies versus expectant management for an hs‚ÄêPDA in reducing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 31 May 2019), Embase (1980 to 31 May 2019), and CINAHL (1982 to 31 May 2019). An updated search was run on 2 October 2020 in the following databases: CENTRAL via CRS Web and MEDLINE via Ovid. We searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi‚Äêrandomized trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs in which early pharmacological treatment, defined as treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth, was compared to no intervention, placebo or other non‚Äêpharmacological expectant management strategies for treatment of an hs‚ÄêPDA in preterm (< 37 weeks‚Äô postmenstrual age) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) infants. Data collection and analysis We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Our primary outcome was all‚Äêcause mortality during hospital stay. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for selected clinical outcomes. Main results We included 14 RCTs that enrolled 910 infants. Seven RCTs compared early treatment (defined as treatment initiated by seven days of age) versus expectant management and seven RCTs compared very early treatment (defined as treatment initiated by 72 hours of age) versus expectant management. No difference was demonstrated between early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth) for an hs‚ÄêPDA for the primary outcome of ‚Äòall‚Äêcause mortality‚Äô (6 studies; 500 infants; typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; typical RD ‚Äê0.02; 95% CI ‚Äê0.07 to 0.03; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), or other important outcomes such as surgical PDA ligation (4 studies; 432 infants; typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.80; typical RD ‚Äê0.03; 95% CI ‚Äê0.09 to 0.03; very low‚Äêcertainty evidence), chronic lung disease (CLD) (4 studies; 339 infants; typical RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.29; typical RD ‚Äê0.03; 95% CI ‚Äê0.10 to 0.03; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (2 studies; 171 infants; typical RR 0.83,95% CI 0.32 to 2.16; typical RD ‚Äê0.01; 95% CI ‚Äê0.08 to 0.06; low‚Äêcertainty evidence), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (5 studies; 473 infants; typical RR 2.34,95% CI 0.86 to 6.41; typical RD 0.04; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.08; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Infants receiving early treatment in the first seven days after birth were more likely to receive any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (2 studies; 232 infants; typical RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.83; typical RD 0.57; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). No difference was demonstrated between very early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first 72 hours after birth) for an hs‚ÄêPDA for the primary outcome of ‚Äòall‚Äêcause mortality‚Äô (7 studies; 384 infants; typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.53; typical RD ‚Äê0.03; 95% CI ‚Äê0.09 to 0.04; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence) or other important outcomes such as surgical PDA ligation (5 studies; 293 infants; typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.17; typical RD ‚Äê0.01; 95% CI ‚Äê0.05 to 0.02; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), CLD (7 studies; 384 infants; typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.08; typical RD ‚Äê0.05; 95% CI ‚Äê0.13 to 0.04; low‚Äêcertainty evidence), severe IVH (4 studies, 240 infants; typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.93; typical RD ‚Äê0.02; 95% CI ‚Äê0.07 to 0.04; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), NEC (5 studies; 332 infants; typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.21; typical RD 0.01; 95% CI ‚Äê0.04 to 0.06; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence) and neurodevelopmental impairment (1 study; 79 infants; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31 for moderate/severe cognitive delay at 18 to 24 months; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.71 for moderate/severe motor delay at 18 to 24 months; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.78 for moderate/severe language delay at 18 to 24 months; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Infants receiving very early treatment in the first 72 hours after birth were more likely to receive any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (4 studies; 156 infants; typical RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.05; typical RD 0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79; very low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Very early treatment, however, shortened the duration of hospitalization compared to expectant management (4 studies; 260 infants; MD ‚Äê5.35 days; 95% CI ‚Äê9.23 to ‚Äê1.47; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Early or very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of an hs‚ÄêPDA probably does not reduce mortality in preterm infants (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). Early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of hs‚ÄêPDA may increase NSAID exposure (low‚Äêcertainty evidence) without likely reducing CLD (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), severe IVH or NEC (low‚Äêcertainty evidence). We are uncertain whether very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of hs‚ÄêPDA also increases NSAID exposure (very low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Very early treatment probably does not reduce surgical PDA ligation, severe IVH or NEC (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), and may not reduce CLD or neurodevelopmental impairment (low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Additional large trials that specifically include preterm infants at the highest risk of PDA‚Äêattributable morbidity, are adequately powered for patient‚Äêimportant outcomes and are minimally contaminated by open‚Äêlabel treatment are required to explore if early targeted treatment of hs‚ÄêPDA improves clinical outcomes. There are currently two trials awaiting classification and two ongoing trials exploring this question. Plain language summary Early treatment versus expectant management of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants Review question Does early treatment (initiated within the first seven days after birth) or very early treatment (initiated within the first 72 hours after birth) of a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with nonsteroidal anti‚Äêinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared to expectant management (without use of NSAIDs) improve outcomes in preterm infants? Background PDA is a common complication in preterm or low birth weight infants. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA often remains open and may contribute to life‚Äêthreatening complications. Medications such as NSAIDs are used to prevent or treat a PDA before it becomes symptomatic. However, there are concerns regarding the side‚Äêeffects of NSAIDs in preterm infants. There is controversy on whether early treatment of a symptomatic PDA improves outcomes in preterm infants. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‚Äêbirth‚Äêweight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants with a symptomatic PDA diagnosed using a combination of specific clinical features and ultrasound of the heart. The included studies compared early treatment, or very early treatment of a symptomatic PDA with NSAIDs compared to expectant management without the use of NSAIDs. The search is up to date as of 2 October 2020. Key results This review of 14 clinical trials (910 infants) found that early or very early treatment of a symptomatic PDA does not reduce death or other poor clinical outcomes in preterm infants. Early or very early treatment, on the other hand, appears to increase the number of preterm infants exposed to NSAIDs. There are currently two trials awaiting classification and two ongoing trials exploring this question. Certainty of evidence According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to moderate but was moderate for the most important outcome of death.",Early treatment versus expectant management of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus for preterm infants,Mitra and  S; Scrivens and  A; von Kursell and  AM; Disher and  T,3,2,2,,3
CD005624.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence, causing varicose veins and venous insufficiency, makes up the majority of lower‚Äêlimb superficial venous diseases. Treatment options for GSV incompetence include surgery (also known as high ligation and stripping), laser and radiofrequency ablation, and ultrasound‚Äêguided foam sclerotherapy. Newer treatments include cyanoacrylate glue, mechanochemical ablation, and endovenous steam ablation. These techniques avoid the need for a general anaesthetic, and may result in fewer complications and improved quality of life (QoL). These treatments should be compared to inform decisions on treatment for varicosities in the GSV. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011. Objectives To assess the effects of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), endovenous steam ablation (EVSA), ultrasound‚Äêguided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), cyanoacrylate glue, mechanochemical ablation (MOCA) and high ligation and stripping (HL/S) for the treatment of varicosities of the great saphenous vein (GSV). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED databases, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 November 2020. We undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) treating participants for varicosities of the GSV using EVLA, RFA, EVSA, UGFS, cyanoacrylate glue, MOCA or HL/S. Key outcomes of interest are technical success, recurrence, complications and QoL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, applied Cochrane's risk of bias tool, and extracted data. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We identified 11 new RCTs for this update. Therefore, we included 24 RCTs with 5135 participants. Duration of follow‚Äêup ranged from five weeks to eight years. Five comparisons included single trials. For comparisons with more than one trial, we could only pool data for 'technical success' and 'recurrence' due to heterogeneity in outcome definitions and time points reported. All trials had some risk of bias concerns. Here we report the clinically most relevant comparisons. EVLA versus RFA Technical success was comparable up to five years (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.38; 5 studies, 780 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence); over five years, there was no evidence of a difference (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.41; 1 study, 291 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). One study reported recurrence, showing no clear difference at three years (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.99; 291 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence), but a benefit for RFA may be seen at five years (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.52 to 5.06; 291 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). EVLA versus UGFS Technical success may be better in EVLA participants up to five years (OR 6.13, 95% CI 0.98 to 38.27; 3 studies, 588 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence), and over five years (OR 6.47, 95% CI 2.60 to 16.10; 3 studies, 534 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). There was no clear difference in recurrence up to three years and at five years (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.36; 2 studies, 443 participants; and OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.87; 2 studies, 418 participants; very low‚Äêcertainty evidence, respectively). EVLA versus HL/S Technical success may be better in EVLA participants up to five years (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.23; 6 studies, 1051 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). No clear difference in technical success was seen at five years and beyond (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.50; 5 studies, 874 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Recurrence was comparable within three years and at 5 years (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.29; 7 studies, 1459 participants; and OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.76; 7 studies, 1267 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence, respectively). RFA versus MOCA There was no clear difference in technical success (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.06 to 54.15; 3 studies, 435 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence), or recurrence (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.81; 3 studies, 389 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Long‚Äêterm data are not available. RFA versus HL/S No clear difference in technical success was detected up to five years (OR 5.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 50.81; 2 studies, 318 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence); over five years, there was no evidence of a difference (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.69; 1 study, 289 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). No clear difference in recurrence was detected up to three years (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.51; 4 studies, 546 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence); but a possible long‚Äêterm benefit for RFA was seen (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.75; 1 study, 289 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). UGFS versus HL/S Meta‚Äêanalysis showed a possible benefit for HL/S compared with UGFS in technical success up to five years (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.94; 4 studies, 954 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence), and over five years (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30; 3 studies, 525 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). No clear difference was detected in recurrence up to three years (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.77; 3 studies, 822 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence), and after five years (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.71; 3 studies, 639 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Complications were generally low for all interventions, but due to different definitions and time points, we were unable to draw conclusions (very‚Äêlow certainty evidence). Similarly, most studies evaluated QoL but used different questionnaires at variable time points. Rates of QoL improvement were comparable between interventions at follow‚Äêup (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Our conclusions are limited due to the relatively small number of studies for each comparison and differences in outcome definitions and time points reported. Technical success was comparable between most modalities. EVLA may offer improved technical success compared to UGFS or HL/S. HL/S may have improved technical success compared to UGFS. No evidence of a difference was detected in recurrence, except for a possible long‚Äêterm benefit for RFA compared to EVLA or HL/S. Studies which provide more evidence on the breadth of treatments are needed. Future trials should seek to standardise clinical terminology of outcome measures and the time points at which they are measured. Plain language summary Which procedures are best for treating varicose veins in the leg? Key messages We are uncertain about which treatments are best for varicose veins because we found only a small number of studies that compared the different types of treatment, and because studies differed in how they measured results. ‚Äê All currently available varicose vein treatments are similar in terms of whether the treatment fully destroys the vein, or stops blood from pooling in the legs, or both (technical success). ‚Äê We need studies that provide more evidence on all the available treatments. What are varicose veins? Varicose veins are bulging, twisty veins close to the skin‚Äôs surface that usually occur in the legs. They are caused by chronic venous insufficiency, which is when your veins do not manage to help blood to flow back up to your heart efficiently, and blood pools in your legs. About one‚Äêthird of adults are thought to have chronic venous insufficiency. Women are more likely than men to have varicose veins. Varicose veins can be painful, itchy and unsightly, especially when standing and walking. Occasionally, they may result in skin changes or sores (ulcers) on the leg that take more than two weeks to heal. How are varicose veins treated? Varicose veins can be treated using a variety of procedures. Traditionally, surgery was used to remove the main surface vein (called the ‚Äògreat saphenous vein‚Äô, which runs from the groin to the ankle) and any connected varicose veins through small openings in the leg. People having this procedure (known as ‚Äòhigh ligation and stripping‚Äô) need to have a general anaesthetic to make them unconscious and stop them from feeling pain or moving while the surgery is done. More recently, several treatments have emerged where the procedure is done inside the vein (endovenous), using a very fine tube. These treatments involve sealing the main vein in the thigh by deliberately damaging the vein wall. There are two main types of treatment: ‚Äê heat‚Äêbased, where heat energy from lasers, radio waves or steam, is used to damage the vein wall; ‚Äê chemical‚Äêbased, where chemicals (including foam or glue) are used to damage and consequently seal the vein. These newer treatments are done using a local anaesthetic, meaning you do not feel pain in your legs during the procedure but you remain awake. What did we want to find out? We wanted to compare all the currently available treatments for varicose veins to find out which is best in terms of: ‚Äê short‚Äê and long‚Äêterm technical success (whether the treatment fully destroys the vein, or stops blood from pooling in the legs, or both); ‚Äê stopping varicose veins from returning (recurrence); ‚Äê avoiding unwanted effects; and ‚Äê improving people‚Äôs well‚Äêbeing. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared treatments for varicose veins in men and women of any age. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 24 studies that involved 5135 people with mild to severe varicose veins. The studies followed people for between 5 weeks to 8 years after their treatment. The majority of the people in the studies were women.

CD004561.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Axillary surgery is an established part of the management of primary breast cancer. It provides staging information to guide adjuvant therapy and potentially local control of axillary disease. Several alternative approaches to axillary surgery are available, most of which aim to spare a proportion of women the morbidity of complete axillary dissection. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of alternative approaches to axillary surgery (including omitting such surgery altogether) in terms of overall survival; local, regional and distant recurrences; and adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Pre‚ÄêMEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 12 March 2015 without language restrictions. We also contacted study authors and checked reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including women with clinically defined operable primary breast cancer conducted to compare axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with no axillary surgery, axillary sampling or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); RCTs comparing axillary sampling with SLNB or no axillary surgery; RCTs comparing SLNB with no axillary surgery; and RCTs comparing ALND with or without radiotherapy (RT) versus RT alone. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed each potentially relevant trial for inclusion. We independently extracted outcome data, risk of bias information and study characteristics from all included trials. We pooled data according to trial interventions, and we used hazard ratios (HRs) for time‚Äêto‚Äêevent outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for binary outcomes. Main results We included 26 RCTs in this review. Studies were at low or unclear risk of selection bias. Blinding was not done, but this was only considered a source of bias for outcomes with potential for subjectivity in measurements. We found no RCTs of axillary sampling versus SLNB, axillary sampling versus no axillary surgery or SLNB versus no axillary surgery. No axillary surgery versus ALND  Ten trials involving 3849 participants compared no axillary surgery versus ALND. Moderate quality evidence showed no important differences between overall survival of women in the two groups (HR 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.17; 3849 participants; 10 studies) although no axillary surgery increased the risk of locoregional recurrence (HR ranging from 1.10 to 3.06; 20,863 person‚Äêyears of follow‚Äêup; four studies). It was uncertain whether no surgery increased the risk of distant metastasis compared with ALND (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; 946 participants; two studies). Low‚Äêquality evidence indicated no axillary surgery decreased the risk of lymphoedema compared with ALND (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.43; 1714 participants; four studies). Axillary sampling versus ALND  Six trials involving 1559 participants compared axillary sampling versus ALND. Low‚Äêquality evidence indicated similar effectiveness of axillary sampling compared with ALND in terms of overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.21; 967 participants; three studies) but it was unclear whether axillary sampling led to increased risk of local recurrence compared with ALND (HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.12; 1404 participants; three studies). The relative effectiveness of axillary sampling and ALND for locoregional recurrence (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 406 participants; one study) and distant metastasis was uncertain (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 406 participants; one study). Lymphoedema was less likely after axillary sampling than after ALND (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81; 80 participants; one study). SLNB versus ALND  Seven trials involving 9426 participants compared SLNB with ALND. Moderate‚Äêquality evidence showed similar overall survival following SLNB compared with ALND (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.25; 6352 participants; three studies; moderate‚Äêquality evidence). Differences in local recurrence (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.77; 516 participants; one study), locoregional recurrence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.24; 5611 participants; one study) and distant metastasis (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.53; 516 participants; one study) were uncertain. However, studies showed little absolute difference in the aforementioned outcomes. Lymphoedema was less likely after SLNB than ALND (OR ranged from 0.04 to 0.60; three studies; 1965 participants; low‚Äêquality evidence). Three studies including 1755 participants reported quality of life: Investigators in two studies found quality of life better after SLNB than ALND, and in the other study observed no difference. RT versus ALND  Four trials involving 2585 participants compared RT alone with ALND (with or without RT) .  High‚Äêquality evidence indicated that overall survival was reduced among women treated with radiotherapy alone compared with those treated with ALND (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.21; 2469 participants; four studies), and local recurrence was less likely in women treated with radiotherapy than in those treated with ALND (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; 22,256 person‚Äêyears of follow‚Äêup; four studies). Risk of distant metastasis was similar for radiotherapy alone as for ALND (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.25; 1313 participants; one study), and whether lymphoedema was less likely after RT alone than ALND remained uncertain (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.44; 200 participants; one study). Less surgery versus ALND  When combining results from all trials, treatment involving less surgery was associated with reduced overall survival compared with ALND (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16; 12,864 participants; 19 studies). Whether local recurrence was reduced with less axillary surgery when compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09; 24,176 participant‚Äêyears of follow up; eight studies). Locoregional recurrence was more likely with less surgery than with ALND (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.78; 26,880 participant‚Äêyears of follow‚Äêup; seven studies). Whether risk of distant metastasis was increased after less axillary surgery compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.20; 2665 participants; five studies). Lymphoedema was less likely after less axillary surgery than with ALND (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46; 3964 participants; nine studies). No studies reported on disease control in the axilla. Authors' conclusions This review confirms the benefit of SLNB and axillary sampling as alternatives to ALND for axillary staging, supporting the view that ALND of the clinically and radiologically uninvolved axilla is no longer acceptable practice in people with breast cancer. Plain language summary Surgical removal of underarm lymph nodes in breast cancer Review question This review aimed to compare the benefits of surgical removal of underarm lymph nodes with the potential harms associated with this surgical procedure. The review also aimed to learn whether complete removal of all underarm nodes could be replaced by procedures that remove only a small number of lymph nodes. Background Surgical removal of underarm (axillary) lymph nodes is often part of the initial surgical treatment for patients with operable breast cancer. If cancer has spread to these lymph nodes, patients are advised to undergo additional treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, to help treat their disease. If cancer has not spread to these lymph nodes, patients are spared extra treatments (with extra side effects). Surgical removal of lymph nodes can lead to short‚Äêterm surgical complications (such as infection and wound healing problems) and long‚Äêterm problems (such as shoulder stiffness, pain and arm swelling (lymphoedema)) when fluid accumulation causes restricted function and discomfort. Modern strategies use a stepwise approach by first removing a small number of nodes and removing the others only if cancer is found at the first stage. This first stage can consist of ‚Äòrandom‚Äô axillary sampling, whereby the surgeon removes a small number of nodes (typically four) that can be felt. Alternatively, surgeons can use sentinel node techniques to identify those nodes most likely to contain cancer, leading to removal of as few nodes as possible. For patients with cancer in the sentinel nodes (or sample), complete removal of all underarm lymph nodes (axillary lymph node dissection) is usually recommended; however, radiotherapy to the axilla can also be given to obliterate any cancer cells in the lymph nodes. Some studies have explored alternative approaches such as no surgical treatment to the underarm nodes. Study characteristics The evidence is current to March 2015. The review identified 26 randomised controlled trials that compared axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with alternative approaches involving less axillary surgery. Patients in these trials had operable primary breast cancer, and some trials included patients with palpably enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Ten trials including 3849 patients compared ALND with no axillary surgery. Six trials including 1559 patients compared ALND with axillary sampling. Seven trials including 9426 patients compared ALND with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Four trials including 2585 patients compared ALND (with or without radiotherapy) with radiotherapy alone. Key results Moderate‚Äêquality evidence suggests that patients treated with approaches involving lesser axillary surgery (such as axillary sampling or SLNB) do not have a reduced chance of survival compared with those treated with ALND. Moderate‚Äêquality evidence indicates that overall survival is slightly reduced in patients who receive radiotherapy (but no axillary surgery) when compared with ALND. If survival is assumed to be 81% five years after surgery with ALND, then the evidence suggests it would be between 77% and 81% after treatment with radiotherapy alone.

CD012309.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a condition that results in the overflow of tears (epiphora) or infection of the nasolacrimal sac (dacryocystitis). The etiology of acquired NLDO is multifactorial and is not fully understood. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is the surgical correction of NLDO, which aims to establish a new drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nose. The success of DCR is variable; the most common cause of failure is fibrosis and stenosis of the surgical ostium. Antimetabolites such as mitomycin‚ÄêC (MMC) and 5‚Äêfluorouracil (5‚ÄêFU) have been shown to be safe and effective in reducing fibrosis and improving clinical outcomes in other ophthalmic surgery settings (e.g. glaucoma and cornea surgery). Application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR has been studied, but the utility of these treatments remains uncertain. Objectives Primary objective:  To determine if adjuvant treatment with antimetabolites improves functional success in the setting of DCR compared to DCR alone. Secondary objectives:  To determine if anatomic success of DCR is increased with the use of antimetabolites, and if the surgical ostium is larger in participants treated with antimetabolites. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eye and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches. We last searched the electronic databases on 6 September 2019. Selection criteria We only included randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies were those that compared the administration of antimetabolites of any dose and concentration versus placebo or another active treatment in participants with NLDO undergoing primary DCR and reoperation. We only included studies that had enrolled adults 18 years or older. We also included studies that used silicone intubation as part of the DCR procedure. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies using an electronic data collection form. Main results We included 31 studies in the review, of which 23 (1309 participants) provided data relating to our primary and secondary outcomes. Many of the 23 studies evaluated functional success, while others also assessed our secondary outcomes of anatomic success or ostium size, or both. Study characteristics Participant characteristics varied across studies, with the age of participants ranging from 30 to 70 years. Participants were predominantly women. These demographics correspond to those most frequently affected by nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Almost all of the studies utilized MMC as the antimetabolite, with only one using 5‚ÄêFU. We assessed most trials as at unclear risk of bias for most domains. Conflicts of interest were not frequently reported, although the antimetabolites used are generic medications, and studies were not likely to be conducted for financial interest. Findings Twenty studies provided data on the primary outcome of functional success, of which 7 (356 participants) provided data at 6 months and 14 (909 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. At six months, the results showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on functional success (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.29; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Beyond six months, the results favored the antimetabolite group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). Fourteen studies reported data on the secondary outcome of anatomic success, of which 4 (306 participants) reported data at 6 months and 12 (831 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. Results at six months showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on anatomic success (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Beyond six months, participants in the antimetabolite group were more likely to achieve anatomic success than those receiving DCR alone (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.15; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). At six months and beyond six months follow‚Äêup, two studies reported mean change in ostium size. We did not conduct meta‚Äêanalysis for the various follow‚Äêup periods due to clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. However, point estimates from these studies at six months consistently favored participants in the antimetabolite group (low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Beyond six months, while point estimates from one study favored participants in the antimetabolite group, estimates from another study showed no evidence of a difference between the two groups. The certainty of evidence at both time points was low. Adverse events Adverse events were rare. One study reported that one participant in the MMC group experienced delayed wound healing. Other studies reported no significant adverse events related to the application of antimetabolites. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence that application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR increases functional and anatomic success of DCR when patients are followed for more than six months after surgery, but no evidence of a difference at six months, low‚Äêcertainty of evidence. There is low‚Äêcertainty evidence that combining antimetabolite with DCR increases the size of the lacrimal ostium at six months. However, beyond six months, the evidence remain uncertain. Adverse effects of the application of antimetabolites were minimal. Plain language summary Antimetabolites as an adjunct to dacryocystorhinostomy for nasolacrimal duct obstruction What is the aim of the review?  Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a type of surgery that creates a new tear drainage pathway between the eyelid and nose to relieve tearing symptoms (functional success), improve openness of the tear duct to irrigation (anatomic success), and increase the size of the opening into the nose (ostium size). Our aim was to assess whether antiscarring medications (antimetabolites) can increase the functional success, anatomic success, and ostium size of DCR. Key results  We found that antimetabolites may improve functional and anatomic success (relative to DCR alone) at a follow‚Äêup time longer than six months. Antimetabolites may also improve ostium size at six months. What was studied in the review?  The lacrimal system of the eye produces tears, which nourish the eye surface and keep it moist. After passing along the eye surface, tears drain into the nose through the lacrimal drainage apparatus. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is the blockage of this canal, which can cause an overflow of tears. NLDO is usually painless and can affect one or both eyes. NLDO can also lead to infection of the eye. NLDO is treated surgically with a procedure known as dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), which establishes a new pathway by creating a pathway between the tear sac and the nose. Antimetabolites have been used to improve success rates of this procedure. We wanted to learn whether DCR in combination with antimetabolites can improve outcomes for functional success, anatomic success, and ostium size than DCR alone. We collected and analyzed all relevant randomized controlled trials to answer this question. What are the main results of the review?  We identified 31 relevant studies for inclusion, most of which originated in South and East Asia and involved predominantly women. These studies compared participants who underwent DCR with metabolites versus participants who underwent DCR alone. Twenty‚Äêthree of these studies (1309 participants) provided data on our outcomes of interest. DCR with antimetabolites may improve functional and anatomic success when patients are followed more than six months after surgery; the certainty of this evidence was moderate. There was no difference in functional and anatomic success at six months among participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites compared to participants who underwent DCR alone; the certainty of evidence is low. At six months, participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites may have increased ostium size compared to those receiving DCR alone. However, beyond six months, there is no evidence of a difference between participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites compared to participants who underwent DCR alone. The certainty of the evidence was low due to substantial variability among the studies that assessed this outcome. Adverse effects of antimetabolites were minimal. How up‚Äêto‚Äêdate is this review?

CD012470.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Wrist fractures, involving the distal radius, are the most common fractures in children. Most are buckle fractures, which are stable fractures, unlike greenstick and other usually displaced fractures. There is considerable variation in practice, such as the extent of immobilisation for buckle fractures and use of surgery for seriously displaced fractures. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for common distal radius fractures in children, including skeletally immature adolescents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and reference lists to May 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‚ÄêRCTs comparing interventions for treating distal radius fractures in children. We sought data on physical function, treatment failure, adverse events, time to return to normal activities (recovery time), wrist pain, and child (and parent) satisfaction. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results Of the 30 included studies, 21 were RCTs, seven were quasi‚ÄêRCTs and two did not describe their randomisation method. Overall, 2930 children were recruited. Typically, trials included more male children and reported mean ages between 8 and 10 years. Eight studies recruited buckle fractures, five recruited buckle and other stable fractures, three recruited minimally displaced fractures and 14 recruited displaced fractures, typically requiring closed reduction, typically requiring closed reduction. All studies were at high risk of bias, mainly reflecting lack of blinding. The studies made 14 comparisons. Below we consider five prespecified comparisons: Removable splint versus below‚Äêelbow cast for predominantly buckle fractures (6 studies, 695 children)  One study (66 children) reported similar Modified Activities Scale for Kids ‚Äê Performance scores (0 to 100; no disability) at four weeks (median scores: splint 99.04; cast 99.11); low‚Äêquality evidence. Thirteen children needed a change or reapplication of device (splint 5/225; cast 8/219; 4 studies); very low‚Äêquality evidence. One study (87 children) reported no refractures at six months. One study (50 children) found no between‚Äêgroup difference in pain during treatment; very low‚Äêquality evidence. Evidence was absent (recovery time), insufficient (children with minor complications) or contradictory (child or parent satisfaction). Two studies estimated lower healthcare costs for removable splints. Soft or elasticated bandage versus below‚Äêelbow cast for buckle or similar fractures (4 studies, 273 children)  One study (53 children) reported more children had no or only limited disability at four weeks in the bandage group; very low‚Äêquality evidence. Eight children changed device or extended immobilisation for delayed union (bandage 5/90; cast 3/91; 3 studies); very low‚Äêquality evidence. Two studies (139 children) reported no serious adverse events at four weeks. Evidence was absent, insufficient or contradictory for recovery time, wrist pain, children with minor complications, and child and parent satisfaction. More bandage‚Äêgroup participants found their treatment convenient (39 children). Removal of casts at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (2 studies, 404 children, mainly buckle fractures) One study (233 children) found full restoration of physical function at four weeks; low‚Äêquality evidence. There were five treatment changes (home 4/197; hospital 1/200; 2 studies; very low‚Äêquality evidence). One study found no serious adverse effects at six months (288 children). Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in pain at four weeks (233 children); low‚Äêquality evidence. One study (80 children) found greater parental satisfaction in the home group; low‚Äêquality evidence. One UK study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. Below‚Äêelbow versus above‚Äêelbow casts for displaced or unstable both‚Äêbone fractures (4 studies, 399 children) Short‚Äêterm physical function data were unavailable but very low‚Äêquality evidence indicated less dependency when using below‚Äêelbow casts. One study (66 children with minimally displaced both‚Äêbone fractures) found little difference in ABILHAND‚ÄêKids scores (0 to 42; no problems) (mean scores: below‚Äêelbow 40.7; above‚Äêelbow 41.8); very low‚Äêquality evidence. Overall treatment failure data are unavailable, but nine of the 11 remanipulations or secondary reductions (366 children, 4 studies) were in the above‚Äêelbow group; very low‚Äêquality evidence. There was no refracture or compartment syndrome at six months (215 children; 2 studies). Recovery time and overall numbers of children with minor complications were not reported. There was little difference in requiring physiotherapy for stiffness (179 children, 2 studies); very low‚Äêquality evidence. One study (85 children) found less pain at one week for below‚Äêelbow casts; low‚Äêquality evidence. One study found treatment with an above‚Äêelbow cast cost three times more in Nepal. Surgical fixation with percutaneous wiring and cast immobilisation versus cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures (5 studies, 323 children) Where reported, above‚Äêelbow casts were used. Short‚Äêterm functional outcome data were unavailable. One study (123 children) reported similar ABILHAND‚ÄêKids scores indicating normal physical function at six months (mean scores: surgery 41.9; cast only 41.4); low‚Äêquality evidence. There were fewer treatment failures, defined as early or problematic removal of wires or remanipulation for early loss in position, after surgery (surgery 20/124; cast only 41/129; 4 studies; very low‚Äêquality evidence). Similarly, there were fewer serious advents after surgery (surgery 28/124; cast only 43/129; 4 studies; very low‚Äêquality evidence). Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There was lower referral for physiotherapy for stiffness after surgery (1 study); very low‚Äêquality evidence. One USA study found similar treatment costs in both groups. Authors' conclusions Where available, the quality of the RCT‚Äêbased evidence on interventions for treating wrist fractures in children is low or very low. However, there is reassuring evidence of a full return to previous function with no serious adverse events, including refracture, for correctly‚Äêdiagnosed buckle fractures, whatever the treatment used. The review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for these injuries. High‚Äêquality evidence is needed to address key treatment uncertainties; notably, some priority topics are already being tested in ongoing multicentre trials, such as FORCE. Plain language summary Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children Background and aim Wrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‚Äêelbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‚Äêelbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). We aimed to assess the best‚Äêquality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. Results of the search We searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. Key results Six studies compared a removable splint with a below‚Äêelbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. Four studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‚Äêelbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). Two studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. Four studies compared below‚Äêelbow versus above‚Äêelbow casts in usually displaced fractures. We are uncertain if children are less dependent on help when using below‚Äêelbow cast",Interventions for treating wrist fractures in children,Handoll and  HHG; Elliott and  J; Iheozor‚ÄêEjiofor and  Z; Hunter and  J; Karantana and  A,3,2,2,,2
CD007444.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Cervical priming before first‚Äêtrimester surgical abortion is recommended in certain groups of women. Nitric oxide (NO) donors induce cervical ripening without uterine contractions, but the efficacy and side effects are of concern. Objectives To evaluate NO donors for cervical ripening before first‚Äêtrimester surgical abortion, in terms of efficacy, side effects, and reduction of complications. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and POPLINE. We also searched reference lists of retrieved papers. We contacted experts in the field for information on both published and unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing NO donors alone or in combination with other methods for cervical ripening in first‚Äêtrimester surgical abortion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected and extracted the data onto a data extraction form. We processed the data using Review Manager ( RevMan 5 ) software. Main results We included 9 studies involving 766 participants. There were no serious complications (infection requiring antibiotic treatment, blood transfusion, complications requiring unintended operation, cervical injury, uterine perforation, death or serious morbidity) in the included trials. NO donors were more effective in cervical ripening when compared with placebo or no treatment. Baseline cervical dilatation before the procedure was higher in NO donors group (mean difference (MD) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.58) The cumulative force required to dilate the cervix to 8 mm (MD ‚Äê4.29, 95% CI ‚Äê9.92 to 1.35), headache (risk ratio (RR) 1.73, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.46), abdominal pain (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.50), or patient satisfaction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07) were not different. More nausea and vomiting occurred in the women who received a NO donor (RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.45). NO donors were inferior to prostaglandins for cervical ripening. The cumulative force required to dilate the cervix to 8 mm to 9 mm was higher (MD 13.12, 95% CI 9.72 to 16.52), and baseline cervical dilatation was less (MD ‚Äê0.73, 95% CI ‚Äê1.01 to ‚Äê0.45) in the NO donor group. However, the probability of dilation greater than 8 mm at three hours was higher in the NO donor group (RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.21 to 20.09). Side effects including headache (RR 5.13, 95% CI 3.29 to 8.00), palpitation (RR 3.43, 95% CI 1.64 to 7.15), dizziness (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.46 to 7.41), and intraoperative blood loss (MD 33.59 ml, 95% CI 24.50 to 42.67) were also higher. However, abdominal pain (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.44) and vaginal bleeding (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27) were less in the NO donor group. No difference for nausea/vomiting in both groups(RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.46). Patient satisfaction was not different. One trial compared a NO donor with a NO donor plus prostaglandin. The cumulative force required to dilate the cervix to 8 mm was higher (MD 14.50, 95% CI 0.50 to 28.50) in the NO donor group. There was no difference in headache (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.00), abdominal pain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.07), or intraoperative blood loss (MD ‚Äê50, 95% CI ‚Äê164.19 to 64.19). Authors' conclusions NO donors are superior to placebo or no treatment, but inferior to prostaglandins for first‚Äêtrimester cervical ripening, and associated with more side effects. Plain language summary Preparing the cervix with nitric oxide donors before surgical abortion in the first three months of pregnancy Possible complications of surgical abortion in the first three months of pregnancy include injury to the cervix (the neck of the womb) and the womb itself. Preparing the cervix before surgery might make the procedure safer and easier. Several methods are used to prepare the cervix. This review compared drugs known as nitric oxide (NO) donors with other drugs. We did a computer search for randomised trials of NO donors used before surgical abortion. We found that NO donors are better than placebo (a sugar pill).

CD006931.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Vitreoretinal surgeons proposed submacular surgery to remove the fibrovascular tissue causing damage to the centre of the retina, in the attempt to limit central visual loss in people affected by neovascular age‚Äêrelated macular degeneration (AMD). Objectives This review aims at assessing the effectiveness of submacular surgery for preserving or improving vision in patients with AMD. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 11 February 2009. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials comparing submacular surgery with any other treatment or observation. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data. The risk ratio (RR) of visual loss and visual gain was estimated at one year. Main results Two multicentre studies with a similar design were conducted between 1997 and 2003 and compared submacular surgery with observation in people affected by subfoveal neovascular AMD with (n=336) or without (n=454) extensive blood in the macula. At one year there was high quality evidence of no benefit for preventing visual loss (RR: 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84 to 1.09). No difference could be demonstrated regarding the chance of visual gain (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.51), although this evidence was of low quality because of imprecision. The risk difference was ‚Äê2% (95% CI: ‚Äê10% to 5%) and 1% (95% CI: ‚Äê4% to 6%) for visual loss and visual gain, respectively, thus excluding a large benefit with surgery in terms of absolute risk in this sample. There was high quality evidence that cataract needing surgery (RR: 8.69; 95% CI: 4.06 to 18.61) and retinal detachment (RR: 6.13; 95% CI: 2.81 to 13.38) were more common among operated patients, and detachment occurred in 5% of patients with no extensive blood and in 18% of those with extensive blood beneath the macula. A pilot study compared submacular surgery with laser photocoagulation in 70 patients. No difference between the two treatments could be demonstrated for any outcome measure, but estimates were very imprecise because of small sample size. Authors' conclusions There is no benefit with submacular surgery in most people with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation due to AMD in terms of prevention of visual loss. Furthermore, the risk of developing cataract and retinal detachment increases after surgery. Plain language summary Surgical removal of choroidal neovascularisation in patients with neovascular age‚Äêrelated macular degeneration Neovascular or wet age‚Äêrelated macular degeneration (AMD) is caused by blood vessels growing as a layer of tissue under the central retina (the macula). The disease leads to the development of a blind spot in the centre of the visual field and is the most common cause of legal blindness among the elderly in the western world. Surgery has been used to remove tissue lying beneath the macula, within which grow the small, new blood vessels which are the cause of wet AMD. It was hoped that removal of this tissue might limit the development of AMD, and perhaps even improve vision.  We found two large multicentre studies conducted in 790 people affected by choroidal neovascularisation, with or without extensive blood beneath the macula. The results of these studies suggested that visual loss cannot be prevented using surgery. In addition, complications such as cataract and retinal detachment can arise during follow‚Äêup, in patients who have the procedure.",Submacular surgery for choroidal neovascularisation secondary to age‚Äêrelated macular degeneration,Giansanti and  F; Eandi and  CM; Virgili and  G,3,2,1,,1
CD010261.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The distal tibial metaphysis is located in the lower (distal) part of the tibia (shin bone). Fractures of this part of the tibia are most commonly due to a high energy injury in young men and to osteoporosis in older women. The optimal methods of surgical intervention for a distal tibial metaphyseal fracture remain uncertain. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical interventions for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. We planned to compare surgical versus non‚Äêsurgical (conservative) treatment, and different methods of surgical intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (9 December 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1946 to November Week 3 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 Week 48), the Airiti Library (1967 to 2014 Week 8), China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (1915 to 2014 Week 8), ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2014) and reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled clinical studies comparing surgical versus non‚Äêsurgical (conservative) treatment or different surgical interventions for treating distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. Our primary outcomes were patient‚Äêreported function and the need for secondary or revision surgery or substantive physiotherapy because of adverse outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias in each study and extracted data. We resolved disagreement by discussion and, where necessary, in consultation with a third author. Where appropriate we pooled data using the fixed‚Äêeffect model. Main results We included three randomised trials that evaluated intramedullary nailing versus plating in 213 participants, with useable data from 173 participants of whom 112 were male. The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 41 to 44 years. There were no trials comparing surgery with non‚Äêsurgical treatment. The three included trials were at high risk of performance bias, with one trial also being at high risk of selection, detection and attrition bias. Overall, the quality of available evidence was rated as very low for all outcomes, meaning that we are very unsure about the estimates for all outcomes. Although the pooled results of three different measures of foot and ankle function indicated a small difference in favour of nailing (standard mean difference 0.28, 95% CI ‚Äê0.02 to 0.59; 172 participants, 3 trials), the results of individual trials indicated that this was very unlikely to be a clinically important difference. Pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the need for reoperation or substantive physiotherapy for adverse events favoured nailing (4/90 versus 10/83; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.12), but included the possibility of a better outcome after plating. Based on an illustrative risk of 100 re‚Äêoperations for adverse outcomes within one year of plate fixation in 1000 people with these fractures, 63 fewer (95% CI 88 fewer to 12 more) people per 1000 would have re‚Äêoperations after nailing. Similarly pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the symptomatic nonunion or malunion, wound complications and fracture union favoured nailing but the 95% confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect and thus included the possibility of a better outcome after plating. Evidence from one trial (85 participants) showed no clinically important difference in pain between the two groups. Authors' conclusions Overall, there is either no or insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the use of surgery or the best surgical intervention for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. The available evidence, which is of very low quality, found no clinically important differences in function or pain, and did not confirm a difference in the need for re‚Äêoperation or risk of complications between nailing and plating. The addition of evidence from two ongoing trials of nailing versus plating should inform this question in future updates. Further randomised trials are warranted on other issues, but should be preceded by research to identify priority questions. Plain language summary Surgical interventions for treating distal tibial fractures (breaks of the lower end of the shin bone) in adults Background Breaks in the lower (distal) end of the shin bone (or tibia) are mostly caused by high‚Äêenergy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents. We set out to compare surgical treatment (such as putting the broken parts back into position and fixing these either by inserting a metal nail into the central cavity of the bone (nailing) or with a metal plate and securing it to the bone using screws (plating)) with non‚Äêsurgical treatment (plaster cast immobilisation). We also set out to compare different methods of surgery such as nailing versus plating. Study characteristics We searched medical databases and trials registries in December 2014. We wanted to include studies in which receiving one surgical treatment or another surgical treatment was decided by chance. This research method, termed a randomised controlled trial (RCT), is the best way to ensure that any measured improvement is caused by the treatment itself and no other factors. We found three RCTs involving 213 adults (with results available from 173) that compared nailing versus plating for treating distal tibial fractures. Overall the studies included around twice as many males as females and the average age of the study participants was just over 40 years. We found no trials comparing surgery with non‚Äêsurgical treatment. Key results We found no clear differences between the nailing and plating groups in terms of patient‚Äêreported functional outcomes, re‚Äêoperations for adverse outcomes, troublesome non‚Äêhealing of the bone or deformity, pain, wound problems such as infection, or the numbers of individuals with healed fractures. Quality of the evidence Only three trials were identified and the sample sizes were small, so the results are imprecise. Moreover, the results of one trial were very likely to be biased due to flawed methodology. We therefore judged the overall quality of evidence to be very low, which means that we are very unsure of these results. Conclusions Overall, the evidence is of very low quality and is insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the best method of surgery, including nailing versus plating, for treating breaks of the lower end of the shin bone in adults. Future updates of this review are likely to include evidence from currently ongoing research comparing nailing versus plating. Although other RCTs are needed to address key clinical questions on surgical methods for treating these fractures, these studies should be preceded by research to determine which questions should be prioritised.",Surgical interventions for treating distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults,Kuo and  LT; Chi and  CC; Chuang and  CH,3,3,3,,2
CD008470.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The annual incidence of ankle fractures is 122 per 100,000 people. They usually affect young men and older women. The question of whether surgery or conservative treatment should be used for ankle fractures remains controversial. Objectives To assess the effects of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ankle fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library , 2012 Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Current Controlled Trials.

Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Authors of the included studies were contacted to obtain original data. Main results Three randomised controlled trials and one quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trial were included. These involved a total of 292 participants with ankle fractures. All studies were at high risk of bias from lack of blinding. Additionally, loss to follow‚Äêup or inappropriate exclusion of participants put two trials at high risk of attrition bias. The trials used different and incompatible outcome measures for assessing function and pain. Only limited meta‚Äêanalysis was possible for early treatment failure, some adverse events and radiological signs of arthritis. One trial, following up 92 of 111 randomised participants, found no statistically significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment in patient‚Äêreported symptoms (self assessed ankle 'troubles': 11/43 versus 14/49; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.76) or walking difficulties at seven years follow‚Äêup. One trial, reporting data for 31 of 43 randomised participants, found a statistically significantly better mean Olerud score in the surgically treated group but no difference between the two groups in pain scores after a mean follow‚Äêup of 27 months. A third trial, reporting data for 49 of 96 randomised participants at 3.5 years follow‚Äêup, reported no difference between the two groups in a non‚Äêvalidated clinical score. Early treatment failure, generally reflecting the failure of closed reduction (criteria not reported in two trials) probably or explicitly leading to surgery in patients allocated conservative treatment, was significantly higher in the conservative treatment group (2/116 versus 19/129; RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.54). Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the reported complications. Pooled results from two trials of participants with radiological signs of osteoarthritis at averages of 3.5 and 7.0 years follow‚Äêup showed no between‚Äêgroup differences (44/66 versus 50/75; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.31). Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude whether surgical or conservative treatment produces superior long‚Äêterm outcomes for ankle fractures in adults. The identification of several ongoing randomised trials means that better evidence to inform this question is likely to be available in future. Plain language summary Surgical versus conservative treatment for ankle fractures in adults Each year, one in every 800 people break (fracture) their ankles. Such injuries typically happen to young men and older women. Ankle fractures can be treated surgically or conservatively (non‚Äêsurgically). Surgery involves an operation to expose the fracture to reposition the broken parts of the bone and then fix them in place using wires, pins, screws and other devices. Treatment after surgery varies but may also include the use of a plaster cast. Conservative treatment involves repositioning of the fractured bone by manipulating it through the skin, followed by immobilisation of the ankle in a plaster cast for several weeks. This review aimed to find out whether surgery or conservative treatment gives a better long‚Äêterm outcome for people with these injuries. This review included four trials, involving a total of 292 participants. All four trials had flawed methods that could affect the reliability of their findings. No data could be pooled for long‚Äêterm measures of function or pain. The largest trial found no evidence of differences between surgery and conservative treatment in patient‚Äêreported symptoms or walking difficulties at seven years follow‚Äêup. The second trial found better results for the surgical group for function but not pain at 27 months, while the third trial reported no difference between the two groups in clinical outcome at 3.5 years. In all four trials, there were some patients in the conservative treatment group who were treated surgically because the repositioning of the fractured bone was judged unsuccessful. Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the reported complications nor in radiological signs of osteoarthritis. Overall, there was not enough reliable evidence to draw conclusions about whether surgery or conservative treatment is more appropriate for treating broken ankles in adults.",Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ankle fractures in adults,Donken and  CCMA; Al‚ÄêKhateeb and  H; Verhofstad and  MHJ; van Laarhoven and  CJHM,3,2,2,conservative…,2
CD004439.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Chronic osteomyelitis is generally treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement but can persist intermittently for years with frequent therapeutic failure or relapse. Despite advances in both antibiotic and surgical treatment, the long‚Äêterm recurrence rate remains around 20%. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009. Objectives To determine the effects of different systemic antibiotic treatment regimens for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1948 to September Week 4 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to 2012 Week 40), LILACS (October 2012), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (June 2012) and reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‚ÄêRCTs addressing the effects of different antibiotic treatments given after surgical debridement for chronic osteomyelitis in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion, extracted data and appraised risk of bias in the included trials. Where appropriate, we pooled data using the fixed‚Äêeffect model. Main results We included eight small trials involving a total of 282 participants with chronic osteomyelitis. Data were available from 248 participants. Most participants were male with post‚Äêtraumatic osteomyelitis, usually affecting the tibia and femur, where recorded. The antibiotic regimens, duration of treatment and follow‚Äêup varied between trials. All trials mentioned surgical debridement before starting on antibiotic therapy as part of treatment, but it was unclear in four trials whether all participants underwent surgical debridement. We found that study quality and reporting were often inadequate. In particular, we judged almost all trials to be at moderate to high risk of bias due to failure to conceal allocation and inadequate follow‚Äêup. Four trials compared oral versus parenteral route for administration of antibiotics. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission at the end of treatment (70/80 versus 58/70; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.18; four trials, 150 participants). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission rate 12 or more months after treatment (49/64 versus 44/54; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13; three trials, 118 participants). There was also no significant difference between the two groups in the occurrence of mild adverse events (11/64 versus 8/54; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.42; three trials, 118 participants) or moderate and severe adverse events (3/49 versus 4/42; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.57; three trials, 91 participants). Superinfection occurred in participants of both groups (5/66 in the oral group versus 4/58 in the parenteral group; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60; three trials, 124 participants). Single trials with few participants found no statistical significant differences for remission or adverse events for the following four comparisons: oral only versus parenteral plus oral administration; parenteral plus oral versus parenteral only administration; two different parenteral antibiotic regimens; and two different oral antibiotic regimens. No trials compared different durations of antibiotic treatment for chronic osteomyelitis, or adjusted the remission rate for bacteria species or severity of disease. Authors' conclusions Limited and low quality evidence suggests that the route of antibiotic administration (oral versus parenteral) does not affect the rate of disease remission if the bacteria are susceptible to the antibiotic used. However, this and the lack of statistically significant differences in adverse effects need confirmation. No or insufficient evidence exists for other aspects of antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis. The majority of the included trials were conducted over 20 years ago and currently we are faced with a far higher prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to many of the available antibiotics used for healthcare. This continuously evolving bacterial resistance represents another challenge in the choice of antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis. Plain language summary Antibiotics for treating chronic bone infection in adults Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of the bone and bone marrow caused by pus‚Äêforming bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi. All bone infection that is long‚Äêstanding is called chronic osteomyelitis. People with this condition are treated with systemic antibiotics, which can be given by mouth or parenterally (i.e. by injection into the muscle or vein). This review is an update of our previous 2009 publication. We included eight small randomised trials involving 282 people. The trials presented results for a total of 248 people with chronic osteomyelitis. Post‚Äêtraumatic bone infections were the most frequent type. Surgical removal of the infected tissue (debridement) before starting on antibiotic therapy was mentioned as part of treatment in all trials, but in four trials it was unclear whether all participants underwent surgery. There were five comparisons of different treatments but we could only pool results for the comparison of antibiotic given by mouth with antibiotic given parenterally. The pooled results (which included data from 150 people) did not show any difference between people given antibiotics by mouth or parenterally in terms of the number of people who did not have symptoms (in 'remission') at the end of treatment (four trials) or 12 months later (or more) (three trials); nor in the number of people that had negative side effects or had a superinfection (another infection that is not sensitive to antibiotic treatment). This evidence suggests that the way antibiotics are given does not impact on the disease remission rate if the bacteria causing the infection are sensitive to the antibiotic used. However, confirmation is needed. There was either no or insufficient evidence on which to base judgements about the optimum length of antibiotic treatment or the best antibiotics to use.",Antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults,Conterno and  LO; Turchi and  MD,3,2,2,after surgical,2
CD010241.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Heavy menstrual bleeding is one of the most common reasons for referral of premenopausal women to a gynaecologist. Although medical therapy is generally first line, many women eventually will require further treatment. Endometrial ablation by hysteroscopic and more recent 'second‚Äêgeneration' devices such as balloon, radiofrequency or microwave ablation offers a day‚Äêcase surgical alternative to hysterectomy. Complete endometrial destruction is one of the main determinants of treatment success. Surgery is most effective if undertaken when endometrial thickness is less than four millimeters. One option is to perform the surgery in the immediate postmenstrual phase, which is not always practical. The other option is to use hormonal agents that induce endometrial thinning pre‚Äêoperatively. The most commonly evaluated agents are goserelin (a gonadotrophin‚Äêreleasing hormone analogue, or GnRHa) and danazol. Other GnRH analogues and progestogens have also been studied, although fewer data are available. It has been suggested that these agents will reduce operating time, improve the intrauterine operating environment and reduce absorption of fluid used for intraoperative uterine cavity distension. They may also improve long‚Äêterm outcomes, including menstrual loss and dysmenorrhoea. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness and safety of pre‚Äêoperative endometrial thinning agents (GnRH agonists, danazol, estrogen‚Äêprogestins and progestogens) versus another agent or placebo when given before endometrial destruction in premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Search methods The following electronic databases were searched to April 2013 for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria: the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register of controlled trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Other electronic sources of trials included trial registers for ongoing and registered trials; citation indexes; conference abstracts in the Web of Knowledge; the LILACS database for trials from the Portuguese‚Äê and Spanish‚Äêspeaking world; PubMed; and the OpenSIGLE database and Google for grey literature. All searches were performed in consultation with the MDSG Trials Search Co‚Äêordinator. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they compared the effects of these agents with one other, or with placebo or no treatment, on relevant intraoperative and postoperative treatment outcomes. Selection of trials was carried out independently by two review authors. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for risk of bias and extracted data on surgical outcomes, effectiveness outcomes, proportion of women requiring further surgical therapy during follow‚Äêup, endometrial outcome measures, acceptability of use outcomes and quality of life. Data were analysed on an intention‚Äêto‚Äêtreat basis. Dichotomous data were combined for meta‚Äêanalysis with RevMan software using the Mantel‚ÄêHaenszel method to estimate pooled risk ratios (RRs). Continuous data were combined for meta‚Äêanalysis with RevMan software using an inverse variance method to estimate the pooled mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The overall quality of evidence for the main findings was assessed with the use of GRADE working group methods. Main results Twenty studies with 1969 women were included in this review. These studies compared GnRHa, danazol and progestogens versus placebo or no treatment; GnRHa versus danazol, progestogens, GnRH antagonists or dilatation & curettage; and danazol versus progestogens. Four studies performed more than one comparison. When compared with no treatment, GnRHa used before hysteroscopic resection were associated with a higher rate of postoperative amenorrhoea at 12 months (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.0, 7 RCTs, 605 women, moderate heterogeneity; I 2  = 40%) and at 24 months (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.52, 2 RCTs, 357 women, no heterogeneity; I 2  = 0%), a slightly shorter duration of surgery (‚Äê3.5 minutes, 95% CI ‚Äê4.7 to ‚Äê2.3, 5 RCTs, 156 women, substantial heterogeneity; I 2  = 72%) and greater ease of surgery (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.46, 2 RCTs, 415 women, low heterogeneity; I 2  = 4%). Postoperative dysmenorrhoea was reduced (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.87, 2 RCTs, 133 women, no heterogeneity; I 2  = 0%). The use of GnRHa had no effect on intraoperative complication rates (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.06, 5 RCTs, 592 women, no heterogeneity; I 2  = 0%), and participant satisfaction with this surgery was high irrespective of the use of pre‚Äêoperative endometrial thinning agents (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05, 6 RCTs, 599 women, low heterogeneity; I 2  = 11%). GnRHa produced more consistent endometrial atrophy than was produced by danazol (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.75, 2 RCTs, 142 women, no heterogeneity; I 2  = 0%). For other intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, any differences were minimal, and no benefits of GnRHa pretreatment were noted in studies in which women underwent second‚Äêgeneration ablation techniques. Both GnRHa and danazol produced side effects in a significant proportion of women, although few studies reported these in detail. Few randomised data were available to allow assessment of the effectiveness of progestogens as endometrial thinning agents. When reported, the long‚Äêterm effects of endometrial thinning agents on benefits such as postoperative amenorrhoea were reduced with time. The main study weaknesses were that most participants received no follow‚Äêup beyond 24 months and that the studies used a small sample size. Heterogeneity for outcomes reported ranged from none to substantial. More than half the trials had no blinding of participants or outcome assessment. Most of the trials were determined to have uncertain selection and reporting bias, as they did not report allocation concealment and evidence of selective reporting was noted. The quality of reporting of adverse events was generally poor, but, when described in the studies, they included menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, hirsutism, decreased libido and voice changes, as well as other side effects such as headache and weight gain. Authors' conclusions Low‚Äêquality evidence suggests that endometrial thinning with GnRHa and danazol before hysteroscopic surgery improves operating conditions and short‚Äêterm postoperative outcomes. GnRHa produced slightly more consistent endometrial thinning than was produced by danazol, although both achieved satisfactory results. The effect of these agents on longer‚Äêterm postoperative outcomes was reduced with time. No benefits of GnRHa pretreatment were apparent with second‚Äêgeneration ablation techniques. Also, side effects were more common when these agents were used. Plain language summary Pre‚Äêoperative endometrial thinning agents before endometrial destruction for heavy menstrual bleeding Review Question Cochrane authors reviewed evidence for the effectiveness and safety of medications used to thin the lining of the womb before surgery performed to destroy (ablate) this lining (endometrium) in premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Background Heavy menstrual bleeding is one of the most common reasons why premenopausal women are referred to a gynaecologist; this condition can cause significant physical, emotional and social stress in a woman's life. Surgery to ablate the endometrium is a treatment option available for this condition that is less invasive than removal of the womb (i.e. hysterectomy). We wanted to discover whether using medications to thin the lining of the womb before endometrial destruction enhanced the effectiveness of surgery in reducing symptoms and improved operating conditions for the surgeon. We also wanted to evaluate the safety of these medications (i.e. observe whether side effects or surgical complications were increased). These medications included gonadotrophin‚Äêreleasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues), danazol and progestogens. Endometrial destruction surgery included either the older 'hysteroscopic' technique, whereby the lining of the womb is destroyed under direct vision, or the newer second‚Äêgeneration techniques, which include balloon, radiofrequency and microwave ablation. Study Characteristics The evidence is current to April 2013. The review included 20 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1969 premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding for whom non‚Äêsurgical treatment had not worked. Studies compared GnRH analogues, danazol and progestogens versus placebo or no treatment; GnRH analogues versus danazol, progestogens, GnRH antagonists or dilatation & curettage; and danazol versus progestogens. Four studies performed more than one comparison. Three studies used the newer second‚Äêgeneration surgical techniques for endometrial destruction. Key Results GnRH analogues and danazol used before hysteroscopic surgery improve both operating conditions for the surgeon and short‚Äêterm bleeding symptoms for women (up to 24 months after surgery). GnRH analogues thin the lining of the womb better and more consistently than danazol, although both agents produce satisfactory results. Adverse effects were more common in women taking GnRH analogues or danazol compared with no treatment, and this was especially true with danazol. Adverse effects included menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, hirsutism, decreased libido and voice changes, as well as other side effects such as headache and weight gain. The use of medications to thin the lining of the womb before surgery does not appear to improve heavy menstrual bleeding in the long term (i.e. longer than 24 months). However, only a few small studies followed up with women for longer than 24 months. Also, medications given to thin the womb lining do not p",Pre‚Äêoperative endometrial thinning agents before endometrial destruction for heavy menstrual bleeding,Tan and  YH; Lethaby and  A,3,2,2,preoperative medicine not compared,2
CD007585.PUB4,"Abstract - Background This is an update of a previous Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2010 and updated in Issue 9, 2015. The role of lymphadenectomy in surgical management of endometrial cancer remains controversial. Lymph node metastases can be found in approximately 10% of women who before surgery are thought to have cancer confined to the womb. Removal of all pelvic and para‚Äêaortic lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) at initial surgery has been widely advocated, and pelvic and para‚Äêaortic lymphadenectomy remains part of the FIGO (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) staging system for endometrial cancer. This recommendation is based on data from studies that suggested improvement in survival following pelvic and para‚Äêaortic lymphadenectomy. However, these studies were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not confer a direct therapeutic benefit, other than allocating women to poorer prognosis groups. Furthermore, the Cochrane review and meta‚Äêanalysis of RCTs of routine adjuvant radiotherapy to treat possible lymph node metastases in women with early‚Äêstage endometrial cancer found no survival advantage. Surgical removal of pelvic and para‚Äêaortic lymph nodes has serious potential short‚Äêterm and long‚Äêterm sequelae. Therefore, it is important to investigate the clinical value of this treatment. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to June 2009 for the original review, updated the search to June 2015 for the last updated version and further extended the search to March 2017 for this version of the review. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria RCTs and quasi‚ÄêRCTs that compared lymphadenectomy versus no lymphadenectomy in adult women diagnosed with endometrial cancer . Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and progression‚Äêfree survival and risk ratios (RRs) comparing adverse events in women who received lymphadenectomy versus those with no lymphadenectomy were pooled in random‚Äêeffects meta‚Äêanalyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Main results 978 unique references were identified via the search strategy. All but 50 were excluded by title and abstract screening. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria; for one small RCT, data were insufficient for inclusion in the meta‚Äêanalysis. The two RCTs included in the analysis randomly assigned 1945 women, reported HRs for survival adjusted for prognostic factors and based on 1851 women and had an overall low risk of bias, as they satisfied four of the assessment criteria. The third study had an overall unclear risk of bias, as information provided was not adequate concerning random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, or completeness of outcome reporting. Results of the meta‚Äêanalysis remained unchanged from the previous versions of this review and indicated no differences in overall and recurrence‚Äêfree survival between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.43; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.58 for overall and recurrence‚Äêfree survival, respectively) (1851 participants, two studies; moderate‚Äêquality evidence). We found no difference in risk of direct surgical morbidity between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy. However, women who underwent lymphadenectomy had a significantly higher risk of surgery‚Äêrelated systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.27; RR 8.39, 95% CI 4.06 to 17.33 for risk of surgery‚Äêrelated systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation, respectively) (1922 participants, two studies; high‚Äêquality evidence). Authors' conclusions This review found no evidence that lymphadenectomy decreases risk of death or disease recurrence compared with no lymphadenectomy in women with presumed stage I disease. Evidence on serious adverse events suggests that women who undergo lymphadenectomy are more likely to experience surgery‚Äêrelated systemic morbidity or lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation. Currently, no RCT evidence shows the impact of lymphadenectomy in women with higher‚Äêstage disease and in those at high risk of disease recurrence. Plain language summary The role of removing lymph nodes as part of standard surgery for endometrial cancer The issue  Cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrial cancer) is now the most common gynaecological cancer among women in western Europe and North America. Most of these women (75%) have tumours confined to the body of the womb at the time of diagnosis, and three‚Äêquarters of women will survive for 10 years after diagnosis. Lymph node metastases can be found in one in 10 women who appear to have cancer confined to the womb at the time of diagnosis, and removal of all pelvic and para‚Äêaortic lymph nodes has been advocated, even for women with presumed early‚Äêstage cancer. This recommendation is based on non‚Äêrandomised studies that suggested improvement in survival following removal of pelvic and para‚Äêaortic lymph nodes. However, treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not be beneficial, and additional treatment to lymph nodes might not necessarily be better treatment, especially as surgical removal of lymph nodes has serious potential short‚Äêterm and long‚Äêterm harmful effects. The aim of the review  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of lymphadenectomy in the management of endometrial cancer. What are the main findings?  We found only three trials that compared lymphadenectomy with no lymphadenectomy among women with endometrial cancer. One of these trials could not be included in the meta‚Äêanalysis of this review, as it provided insufficient information about outcomes for women. When we combined findings from the two remaining trials, which included 1945 women, we found no evidence that women who received lymphadenectomy were less likely to die or have a relapse of their cancer. In addition, severe adverse events experienced as a consequence of lymphadenectomy outnumbered those reported when no lymphadenectomy was performed. Quality of the evidence  The overall quality of the evidence for lymphadenectomy versus standard surgery was moderate for survival outcomes and adverse events (other than evidence for presence or absence of lymphoedema or lymphocyst, which was of high quality). The quality of evidence for quality of life was very low, as this outcome was not reported. What are the conclusions?  The uncertainty of whether lymphadenectomy or no lymphadenectomy is best in the management of early‚Äêstage endometrial cancer probably reflects the fact that evidence shows no reduction in death or in disease relapse when lymphadenectomy is performed, rather than lack of evidence. In addition, women undergoing lymphadenectomy experienced more severe adverse events than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy.",Lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer,Frost and  JA; Webster and  KE; Bryant and  A; Morrison and  J,3,2,2,unclear what the other group is,3
CD002764.PUB2,"Abstract - Background This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2000. Intestinal obstruction commonly occurs in progressive advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancers. Management of these patients is difficult due to the patients' deteriorating mobility and function (performance status), the lack of further chemotherapeutic options, and the high mortality and morbidity associated with palliative surgery. There are marked variations in clinical practice concerning surgery in these patients between different countries, gynaecological oncology units and general hospitals, as well as referral patterns from oncologists under whom these patients are often admitted. Objectives To assess the efficacy of surgery for intestinal obstruction due to advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer. Search methods We searched the following databases for the original review in 2000 and again for this update in June 2015: CENTRAL (2015, Issue 6); MEDLINE (OVID June week 1 2015); and EMBASE (OVID week 24, 2015). We also searched relevant journals, bibliographic databases, conference proceedings, reference lists, grey literature and the world wide web for the original review in 2000; we also used personal contact. This searching of other resources yielded very few additional studies. The Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Review Group no longer routinely handsearch journals. For these reasons, we did not repeat the searching of other resources for the June 2015 update. Selection criteria As the review concentrates on the 'best evidence' available for the role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction in known advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer we kept the inclusion criteria broad (including both prospective and retrospective studies) so as to include all studies relevant to the question. We sought published trials reporting on the effects of surgery for resolving symptoms in malignant bowel obstruction for adult patients with known advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer. Data collection and analysis We used data extraction forms to collect data from the studies included in the review. Two review authors extracted the data independently to reduce error. Owing to concerns about the risk of bias we decided not to conduct a meta‚Äêanalysis of data and we have presented a narrative description of the study results. We planned to resolve disagreements by discussion with the third review author. Main results In total we have identified 43 studies examining 4265 participants. The original review included 938 patients from 25 studies. The updated search identified an additional 18 studies with a combined total of 3327 participants between 1997 and June 2015. The results of these studies did not change the conclusions of the original review. No firm conclusions can be drawn from the many retrospective case series so the role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction remains controversial. Clinical resolution varies from 26.7% to over 68%, though it is often unclear how this is defined. Despite being an inadequate proxy for symptom resolution or quality of life, the ability to feed orally was a popular outcome measure, with success rates ranging from 30% to 100%. Rates of re‚Äêobstruction varied, ranging from 0% to 63%, though time to re‚Äêobstruction was often not included. Postoperative morbidity and mortality also varied widely, although again the definition of both of these surgical outcomes differed between many of the papers. There were no data available for quality of life. The reporting of adverse effects was variable and this has been described where available. Where discussed, surgical procedures varied considerably and outcomes were not reported by specific intervention. Using the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool, most included studies were at high risk of bias for most domains. Authors' conclusions The role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction needs careful evaluation, using validated outcome measures of symptom control and quality of life scores. Further information could include re‚Äêobstruction rates together with the morbidity associated with the various surgical procedures. Currently, bowel obstruction is managed empirically and there are marked variations in clinical practice by different units. In order to compare outcomes in malignant bowel obstruction, there needs to be a greater degree of standardisation of management. Since the last version of this review none of the new included studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. Plain language summary Surgery for resolving symptoms associated with malignant bowel obstruction in advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancers Background Advanced cancer causes a range of complex problems for patients. In gynaecological (for example ovarian and womb) and gastrointestinal (for example colon or bowel) cancers, the bowel can become blocked or obstructed by the original tumour, metastatic deposits or due to the side effects of previous treatments. The decision to operate on patients with bowel obstruction who are already very unwell because of their advanced cancer is difficult. Often, these people develop bowel obstruction as a sign that the cancer is progressing and they are in the process of dying. When the bowel obstructs in this situation, surgery might be useful for some patients, it might make no difference to how long the patient has to live, or it might make the situation worse due to the complications of surgery. When time is short, managing symptoms and maximising comfort for the patient is the priority. Different surgical teams adopt different approaches. We wanted to establish the evidence for the benefit and harm of surgery in these situations and therefore help patients and doctors make good decisions. Key findings and quality of the evidence We first looked at the evidence in 2000 and this is an update of the original review. In total we found 43 studies examining 4265 people. We looked at adults with advanced gynaecological or gastrointestinal cancer who developed bowel obstruction and had either surgical or non‚Äêsurgical treatment. The studies we found were of low quality and measured success and benefit in different ways. It was therefore not possible to compare these studies and conclude whether surgery was of benefit or harm in this situation. Research in this area is problematic and the type of study needed to answer this question would be very difficult to conduct.",Surgery for the resolution of symptoms in malignant bowel obstruction in advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer,Cousins and  SE; Tempest and  E; Feuer and  DJ,3,2,3,actually could be medical management,3
CD007119.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Central venous catheters (CVCs) facilitate the administration of intravenous drugs, fluids, blood products and parenteral nutrition to patients with either chronic disease or critical illness. Despite a pivotal role within medical management, a common complication associated with CVC use is occlusion of the CVC lumen(s). CVC occlusion can interrupt and cause serious delays in administration of treatment interventions. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of different interventions used to restore patency of occluded CVC lumens, in adults and children. Search methods We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 9); OvidSP MEDLINE (1950 to September 2011); OvidSP EMBASE (1980 to September 2011) and NHS Evidence CINAHL (1982 to September 2011). We also searched clinical trial registers, handsearched reference lists, contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of publications that met the inclusion criteria to identify trials. Selection criteria We selected randomized controlled trials which investigated the efficacy of an intervention (chemical, surgical or drug) used to restore patency to an occluded CVC lumen, in either adults or children. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently assessed those studies that met the inclusion criteria for quality and extracted the relevant data using a standardized form. Main results No studies were found that investigated the efficacy and safety of either chemical or surgical interventions. Seven studies (eight papers) with a total of 632 participants were identified from the search. They investigated different comparisons, strengths of thrombolytic or anticoagulant drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion thought to be caused by a thrombus. There was low quality evidence from a meta‚Äêanalysis of two studies suggesting that urokinase (various strengths) was more effective than placebo for restoring patency to occluded CVC lumens in adults and children with underlying medical conditions (relative risk (RR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47 to 2.95), with a number needed to treat of 4 (95% CI 2 to 8). There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the safety of urokinase. The overall quality of the evidence provided by these studies was low to very low due to one or more domains being assessed as either at 'unclear risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias'. Furthermore, the total number of participants in these studies was small and consequently may lead to spurious results. Authors' conclusions There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta‚Äêanalysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted. Plain language summary Interventions for restoring patency of occluded central venous catheter lumens A central venous catheter is a small, hollow tube that is inserted into a large vein in either the chest, neck or groin. Central venous catheters enable healthcare professionals to administer drugs and other fluids directly into the blood stream, in order to treat critically ill patients or those patients with a long‚Äêterm condition. In certain chronic conditions, patients or their carers may also be involved with the administration of treatment interventions via the central venous catheter. Occasionally, the catheter lumens can become blocked with either a blood clot or a treatment intervention solidifying in the tube, or due to the position of the tube inside the vein. If the catheter does become blocked it may mean that the patient has to undergo further surgery to remove and replace the blocked catheter. No studies were found investigating the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions (brush, snare or guidewire exchange) or chemical interventions (hydrochloric acid, sodium bicarbonate, 70% ethanol solution) to unblock the catheter. Our search identified seven studies (eight papers), with a total of 632 participants, that investigated different drug comparisons or compared different strengths of drug therapies for treating catheters that were either completely or partially blocked with a blood clot. This review has found low to very low quality evidence suggesting that thrombolytic drugs (urokinase and alteplase) could be effective in unblocking central venous catheter lumens blocked by blood clots. However, the total number of participants included in these trials was small and consequently the results of the analysis may well be over exaggerated. There were also issues with the way the studies were conducted that could possibly have introduced bias. In conclusion, more research is required to establish the efficacy and safety of different treatment interventions used to unblock occluded central venous catheter lumens. Particularly, there is a need for studies exclusively in children.",Interventions for restoring patency of occluded central venous catheter lumens,van Miert and  C; Hill and  R; Jones and  L,3,2,2,,1
CD008509.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Ureteral colic is a common reason for patients to seek medical care. Alpha‚Äêblockers are commonly used to improve stone passage through so‚Äêcalled medical expulsive therapy (MET), but their effectiveness remains controversial. This is an update of a 2014 Cochrane review; since that time, several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant. Objectives To assess effects of alpha‚Äêblockers compared with standard therapy for ureteral stones 1 cm or smaller confirmed by imaging in adult patients presenting with symptoms of ureteral stone disease. Search methods On 18 November 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP to identify all published/unpublished and ongoing trials. We checked all references of included and review articles and conference proceedings for articles relevant to this review. We sent letters to investigators to request information about unpublished or incomplete studies. Selection criteria We included RCTs of ureteral stone passage in adult patients that compared alpha‚Äêblockers versus standard therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures. We performed meta‚Äêanalysis using a random‚Äêeffects model. Primary outcomes were stone clearance and major adverse events; secondary outcomes were stone expulsion time, number of pain episodes, use of diclofenac, hospitalisation, and surgical intervention. We assessed the quality of evidence on a per‚Äêoutcome basis using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 67 studies with 10,509 participants overall. Of these, 15 studies with 5787 participants used a placebo. Stone clearance: Based on the overall analysis, treatment with an alpha‚Äêblocker may result in a large increase in stone clearance (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 1.55; low‚Äêquality evidence). A subset of higher‚Äêquality, placebo‚Äêcontrolled trials suggest that the likely effect is probably smaller (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate‚Äêquality evidence), corresponding to 116 more (95% CI 51 more to 182 more) stone clearances per 1000 participants. Major adverse events: Based on the overall analysis, treatment with an alpha‚Äêblocker may have little effect on major adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.96; low‚Äêquality evidence). A subset of higher‚Äêquality, placebo‚Äêcontrolled trials suggest that alpha‚Äêblockers likely increase the risk of major adverse events slightly (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.86), corresponding to 29 more (95% CI 3 more to 75 more) major adverse events per 1000 participants. Patients treated with alpha‚Äêblockers may experience shorter stone expulsion times (mean difference (MD) ‚Äê3.40 days, 95% CI ‚Äê4.17 to ‚Äê2.63; low‚Äêquality evidence), may use less diclofenac (MD ‚Äê82.41, 95% CI ‚Äê122.51 to ‚Äê42.31; low‚Äêquality evidence), and likely require fewer hospitalisations (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.77; moderate‚Äêquality evidence), corresponding to 69 fewer hospitalisations (95% CI 93 fewer to 32 fewer) per 1000 participants. Meanwhile, the need for surgical intervention appears similar (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02; low‚Äêquality evidence), corresponding to 28 fewer surgical interventions (95% CI 51 fewer to 2 more) per 1000 participants. A predefined subgroup analysis (test for subgroup differences; P = 0.002) suggests that effects of alpha‚Äêblockers may vary with stone size, with RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.15; P = 0.16; I¬≤ = 62%) for stones 5 mm or smaller versus 1.45 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.72; P < 0.0001; I¬≤ = 59%) for stones larger than 5 mm. We found no evidence suggesting possible subgroup effects based on stone location or alpha‚Äêblocker type. Authors' conclusions For patients with ureteral stones, alpha‚Äêblockers likely increase stone clearance but probably also slightly increase the risk of major adverse events. Subgroup analyses suggest that alpha‚Äêblockers may be less effective for smaller (5 mm or smaller) than for larger stones (greater than 5 mm). Plain language summary Alpha‚Äêblockers for ureteral stones in adult patients with symptoms of stone disease Review question Does medical treatment with alpha‚Äêblockers improve the outcomes of patients with stones stuck in their ureter? Background Stones stuck in the ureter, which is the tube that transports urine from the kidney to the bladder, often cause pain and make people see a doctor. Depending on which part of the ureter the stone is stuck in and the size of the stone, it will often pass into the bladder on its own over the course of weeks. If the stone does not come out by itself, people often need to have procedures done to remove the stone. Alpha‚Äêblockers are medications that relax muscles in the urinary tract and may make the stone pass into the bladder faster. However, they can cause unwanted effects. We updated an existing Cochrane Review from 2014 to look into the effects of alpha‚Äêblockers. Study characteristics Based on our latest search of the literature from November 2017, we included 64 studies with 10,509 participants. Of these, 15 studies compared alpha‚Äêblockers with placebo with 5787 participants. A placebo is a pill that looks and tastes exactly like the real medication, so participants did not know what they were getting. These were the higher‚Äêquality studies, which we trusted more. Key results Based on the subset of higher‚Äêquality studies that used a placebo, alpha‚Äêblockers likely resulted in more people passing their stones. However, these patients are likely to experience slightly more serious unwanted effects of this medication. People taking alpha‚Äêblockers may pass their stones in a shorter time, may use less diclofenac (which is a type of pain medication), and are likely to be admitted to the hospital less often. Meanwhile, the need for surgery for their stones was similar. Upon completing additional analyses, we found that effects of alpha‚Äêblockers may be different in people with small (5 mm or smaller) versus larger (larger than 5 mm) stones. It appears that this medication works better in people with larger stones. We could find no difference in how well alpha‚Äêblockers work, no matter where in the ureter the stone is stuck or what type of alpha‚Äêblocker is used. Authors' conclusions For patients with stones stuck in the ureter, alpha‚Äêblockers likely make passing the stone easier but cause slightly more unwanted effects. It appears that alpha‚Äêblockers work better in people with larger (greater than 5 mm) rather than smaller (5 mm or smaller) stones. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence for most outcomes was moderate or low, meaning that we have moderate or low confidence in most of the reported results.",Alpha‚Äêblockers as medical expulsive therapy for ureteral stones,Campschroer and  T; Zhu and  X; Vernooij and  RWM; Lock and  MTWT,3,2,3,the standard therapy would it be considered surgical?

CD013085.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction, or a combination of these with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It can result in a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options or therapies for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) is a relatively cheap option and potentially efficient way to deliver physical therapy for people with CVI. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Clinical Trials.gov trials register to August 2018. We searched the LILACS and IBECS databases. We also checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy with no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed studies retrieved by the search strategies. Both review authors independently assessed selected studies for complete analysis. We resolved conflicts through discussion. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, obtaining additional information. For binary outcomes (leg ulcer incidence and adverse events), we presented the results using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes (disease severity, health‚Äêrelated quality of life (HRQoL), pain, oedema, skin pigmentation), we presented the results as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Main results We included seven randomised controlled trials with 891 participants (outpatients in secondary care). We found no quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials. Six studies (836 participants) evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment. One study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug ( melilotus officinalis ) (55 participants). There was a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, imprecision and inconsistency, which downgraded the certainty of the evidence. For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison, there probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptom score as assessed using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (MD ‚Äì1.66, 95% CI ‚Äì4.14 to 0.83; 2 studies, 484 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably resulted in a moderate improvement in HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CVIQ2) at three months (MD ‚Äì9.38, 95% CI ‚Äì18.18 to ‚Äì0.57; 2 studies, 149 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), nine months (MD ‚Äì10.46, 95% CI ‚Äì11.81 to ‚Äì9.11; 1 study; 55 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), and 12 months (MD ‚Äì4.99, 95% CI ‚Äì9.19 to ‚Äì0.78; 2 studies, 455 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). There was no clear difference in HRQoL between balneotherapy and no treatment at six months (MD ‚Äì1.64, 95% CI ‚Äì9.18 to 5.89; 2 studies, 445 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably slightly improved pain compared with no treatment (MD ‚Äì1.23, 95% CI ‚Äì1.33 to ‚Äì1.13; 1 study; 390 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). There was no clear effect related to oedema between the two groups at 24 days (MD 43.28 mL, 95% CI ‚Äì102.74 to 189.30; 2 studies, 153 participants; very‚Äêlow certainty evidence). There probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in the incidence of leg ulcers (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.48; 2 studies, 449 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). There was probably a reduction in incidence of skin pigmentation changes in favour of balneotherapy at 12 months (pigmentation index: MD ‚Äì3.59, 95% CI ‚Äì4.02 to ‚Äì3.16; 1 study; 59 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence). The main complications reported included erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), thromboembolic events (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study; 59 participants; low‚Äêcertainty evidence), with no clear evidence of an increase in reported adverse effects with balneotherapy. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies. For the balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug ( melilotus officinalis ) comparison, we observed no clear difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study; 35 participants; very low‚Äêcertainty evidence) and oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study; 35 participants; very low‚Äêcertainty evidence). This single study did not report on the other outcomes of interest. Authors' conclusions We identified moderate‚Äê to low‚Äêcertainty evidence that suggests that balneotherapy may result in a moderate improvement in pain, quality of life and skin pigmentation changes and has no clear effect on disease severity signs and symptoms score, adverse effects, leg ulcers and oedema when compared with no treatment. For future studies, measurements of outcomes such as disease severity sign and symptom score, quality of life, pain and oedema and choice of time points during follow‚Äêup must be standardised for adequate comparison between trials. Plain language summary Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) Background Chronic venous insufficiency is a disease caused by abnormal transport of blood into the veins of the lower limbs, which means the veins cannot pump enough blood back to the heart. This condition is defined by several signs, with gnarled and enlarged veins being the most common and venous ulcers being the most severe. There is a wide variety of management options or therapies for chronic venous insufficiency, ranging from surgery and medicine, to compression (applying force) and physical therapies. Balneotherapy is a possible way to deliver physical therapy for people with chronic venous insufficiency. Balneotherapy is a traditional medical technique that involves water and is usually practiced in spas. It consists of the immersion in mineral water or mud loaded with minerals. It may or may not include exercise. Alone or combined with usual care, balneotherapy may provide a significant improvement in the quality of life of people with chronic venous insufficiency when compared with usual care alone. Study characteristics We identified seven randomised controlled trials (studies in which the participants were divided between treatment groups through random method) (most recent search August 2018). Six studies compared balneotherapy versus no treatment, and one study compared balneotherapy versus a medicine called  melilotus officinalis . The studies used different types of balneotherapy and different treatment times. Key results and certainty of the evidence For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison there probably is no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptoms score (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably improves health‚Äêrelated quality of life and pain (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). There probably is no improvement in favour of balneotherapy for leg ulcers (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). There is no clear effect related to oedema (swelling caused when fluid leaks out of the body's tiny blood vessels) between balneotherapy and no treatment (very low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably reduces skin pigmentation changes (low‚Äêcertainty evidence). None of the studies reported any serious adverse events. There were fewer side effects (infection and blood clots in the legs) in people receiving balneotherapy compared to no treatment. When comparing balneotherapy with  melilotus officinalis , there were insufficient data to detect clear differences between the two treatments for pain and oedema in the single small study. There were no data available for the other outcomes of interest such as disease severity signs and symptoms score, quality of life, leg ulcers and skin pigmentation. The certainty of the evidence was affected by the small number of trials with few participants and the impossibility of blinding of participants and physicians conducting the balneotherapy treatment, which could have led to bias.",Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency,de Moraes Silva and  MA; Nakano and  LCU; Cisneros and  LL; Miranda Jr and  F,3,2,2,,3
CD006087.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non‚Äêsurgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach. Objectives The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non‚Äêsurgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013),  meta Register of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random‚Äêeffects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors. Main results Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF‚Ñ¢ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient‚Äêoriented outcomes were largely ignored and post‚Äêoperative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post‚Äêoperative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0%). Similarly, no difference in post‚Äêoperative infection between the use of two 3‚Äêdimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events. Authors' conclusions This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances. Plain language summary Treatments for fractures of the lower jaw Review question The lower jaw (also known as the mandible) is an important bone that shapes the face, holds the lower teeth in place and is used to move the mouth, for talking and chewing food. Fractures are most often found in the part of the lower jaw that supports teeth (known as the body), the part where the jaw curves upwards into the neck (the angle), or at the knobbly‚Äêshaped joint found at the very top of the jaw bone (the condyle). Available treatments align and stabilize the fracture, allowing the bone to heal in the proper position. Treatments may or may not involve surgery. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines different methods for treating fractures of the body and angle of the mandible in existing research and studies. Background People of all ages can fracture their lower jaw, but fractures mainly occur as a result of violence (for example, being hit or punched in the jaw) or by being involved in an accident on the road (for example, car crashes or bicycle accidents). These fractures can be stabilized by physically binding the jaw shut with a system of bars, wires or elastic bands (intermaxillary fixation), or by using tiny screws or plates attached directly to the fractured sections of the lower jaw bone whilst still allowing the mouth to open (rigid fixation). Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery. Key results There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non‚Äêsurgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non‚Äêsurgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well‚Äêconducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.",Interventions for the management of mandibular fractures,Nasser and  M; Pandis and  N; Fleming and  PS; Fedorowicz and  Z; Ellis and  E; Ali and  K,3,2,3,closed interesting,3
CD009959.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Frey's syndrome is a rare disorder, the symptoms of which include sweating, flushing and warming over the preauricular and temporal areas following a gustatory stimulus. It often occurs in patients who have undergone parotidectomy, submandibular gland surgery, radical neck dissection, infection and traumatic injury in the parotid region, and is caused by the aberrant regrowth of facial autonomic nerve fibres. Currently there are several options used to treat patients with Frey's syndrome; for example, the topical application of anticholinergics and antiperspirants, and the intradermal injection of botulinum toxin. It is uncertain which treatment is most effective and safe. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of different interventions for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 28 April 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) in participants diagnosed with Frey's syndrome using a clinical standard such as Minor's starch‚Äêiodine test. We planned to include trials in which participants received any intervention versus no treatment (observation) or an alternative intervention, with or without a second active treatment. Our primary outcome measures were success rate (as assessed clinically by Minor's starch‚Äêiodine test, the iodine‚Äêsublimated paper histogram method, blotting paper technique or another method) and adverse events. Our secondary outcome measure was success rate as assessed by patients (disappearance or improvement of symptoms). Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We identified no RCTs or quasi‚ÄêRCTs that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Our searches retrieved eight potentially relevant studies, but after assessment of the full‚Äêtext reports we excluded all of them due to the absence of randomisation or because the patients did not have Frey's syndrome. We excluded one randomised controlled trial that compared two different doses of botulinum toxin in patients with Frey's syndrome because the comparator was not an alternative treatment. Authors' conclusions We are unable to establish the efficacy and safety of the different methods used for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. RCTs are urgently needed to assess the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. Future RCTs should include patients with Frey's syndrome of different ranges of severity and report these patients separately. Studies should investigate all possibly effective treatments (such as anticholinergics, antiperspirants and botulinum toxin) compared to control groups using different treatments or placebo. Subjective assessment of Frey's syndrome should be considered as one of the outcome measures. Plain language summary Interventions for the treatment of Frey's syndrome Background Frey's syndrome is a rare disorder, the symptoms of which include sweating and Ô¨Çushing of the facial skin when eating, smelling, thinking or even dreaming about food. It usually happens in patients who have undergone surgery to the parotid (salivary) gland. This problem may have an impact on quality of life (for example, restricting normal activity such as eating in public). Many methods are currently used to treat Frey's syndrome, including topical application of anticholinergics and antiperspirants, and intradermal (into the skin) injections of botulinum toxin. This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of these different methods for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. Study characteristics We carried out a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in participants diagnosed with Frey's syndrome. We planned to include trials in which participants received any intervention compared to no treatment (observation) or an alternative intervention, with or without a second active treatment. Despite extensive searching, we were unable to identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. Key results There is no high‚Äêquality evidence to establish which type of treatment is most effective for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. High‚Äêquality clinical trials in this area should be urgently conducted. Studies should investigate all possibly effective treatments (such as anticholinergics, antiperspirants and botulinum toxin) compared to control groups using different treatments or placebo.

CD003171.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Congenital cataracts are opacities of the lens in one or both eyes of children that cause a reduction in vision severe enough to require surgery. Cataract is the largest treatable cause of visual loss in childhood. Paediatric cataracts provide different challenges to those in adults. Intense inflammation, amblyopia and posterior capsule opacification can affect results of treatment. Two treatments commonly considered for congenital cataract are lensectomy and lens aspiration. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of surgical treatments for bilateral symmetrical congenital cataracts. Success was measured according to the vision attained and occurrence of adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on  The Cochane Library,  which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register (2005, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2005), EMBASE (1980 to June 2005, week 27), LILACS (6 July 2005), the Science Citation Index and the reference list of the included studies. We also contacted trial investigators and experts in the field for details of further studies. Selection criteria We included all prospective, randomised controlled trials that compared one type of cataract surgery to another, or to no surgery, in children with bilateral congenital cataracts aged 15 years or younger. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data. No meta‚Äêanalysis was performed. Main results Four trials met the inclusion criteria. All trials were concerned with reducing the development of visual axis opacification (VAO). This was achieved with techniques that included an anterior vitrectomy or optic capture. Posterior capsulotomy alone was inadequate except in older children. Authors' conclusions Evidence exists for the care of children with congenital or developmental bilateral cataracts to reduce the occurrence of visual axis opacification. Further randomised trials are required to inform modern practice about other concerns including the timing of surgery, age for implantation of an intraocular lens and development of long‚Äêterm complications such as glaucoma and retinal detachment. Plain language summary Surgery for cataracts that develop in both eyes at or soon after birth To have a cataract describes a condition where the normally clear lens inside the eye is cloudy and obscures vision. Cataracts that develop at or soon after birth in both eyes are a major cause of childhood blindness in the world, especially in developing countries. Treatment is indicated if the cataract prevents normal vision. This can be assessed by measuring how much the child can see and looking into the eye at the cataract. The only way to correct the cataract is to surgically remove it. It is generally accepted that early surgery results in a greater chance of good vision. There are two main approaches to surgery: lensectomy and lens aspiration. Lensectomy removes the entire lens and some of the gel which fills the eye (anterior vitrectomy); lens aspiration removes the lens but leaves the posterior lens capsule intact. A significant complication from surgery is re‚Äêclouding of the central passage for vision (visual axis opacification (VAO)). All surgical procedures aim to reduce this and the need for further treatment. Removing the cataract leaves the eye without the ability to focus. This must be corrected as soon as possible after surgery using intraocular lenses (IOL), contact lenses or spectacles, or a combination. The aim of the review was to clarify which surgical approach resulted in the best visual improvement. We searched for studies where children with cataract at or soon after birth had been randomised to receive a type of surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the level of vision after surgery. In the four included randomised studies the type of surgical procedure made no real difference to the final vision but there were differences in the number of children who developed VAO. Procedures which appeared to reduce VAO were anterior vitrectomy (removing some of the gel which fills the eye) and optic capture (lodging the lens portion of the IOL into an opening created in the posterior capsule). Three of the four studies used IOLs to correct aphakia, an option increasingly popular but which may not be suitable in regions where careful follow up cannot be guaranteed. While there is evidence for successful surgical treatment of this type of potentially blinding cataract, there is a lack of good evidence regarding aspects of its delivery such as the best timing for surgery and the appropriate method for aftercare.",Surgical interventions for bilateral congenital cataract,Long and  V; Chen and  S; Hatt and  SR,3,2,2,no surgery,2
CD004008.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends eliminating trachomatous blindness through the SAFE strategy: Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotic treatment, Facial cleanliness and Environmental hygiene. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for trachomatous trichiasis for people living in endemic settings. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‚ÄêProcess and Other Non‚ÄêIndexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2015), the ISRCTN registry ( www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 7 May 2015. We searched the reference lists of included studies to identify further potentially relevant studies. We also contacted authors for details of other relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised trials of any intervention intended to treat trachomatous trichiasis. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently selected and assessed the trials, including the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for missing data when necessary. Our primary outcome was post‚Äêoperative trichiasis which was defined as any lash touching the globe at three months, one year or two years after surgery. Main results Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria with 8586 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in sub‚ÄêSaharan Africa. The majority of the studies were of a low or unclear risk of bias. Five studies compared different surgical interventions. Most surgical interventions were performed by non‚Äêphysician technicians. These trials suggest the most effective surgery is full‚Äêthickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the terminal tarsal strip. Pooled data from two studies suggested that the bilamellar rotation was more effective than unilamellar rotation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.50). Use of a lid clamp reduced lid contour abnormalities (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98) and granuloma formation (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.97). Absorbable sutures gave comparable outcomes to silk sutures (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20) and were associated with less frequent granuloma formation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.99). Epilation was less effective at preventing eyelashes from touching the globe than surgery for mild trichiasis, but had comparable results for vision and corneal change. Peri‚Äêoperative azithromycin reduced post‚Äêoperative trichiasis; however, the estimate of effect was imprecise and compatible with no effect or increased trichiasis (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; 1954 eyes; 3 studies). Community‚Äêbased surgery when compared to health centres increased uptake with comparable outcomes. Surgery performed by ophthalmologists and integrated eye care workers was comparable. Adverse events were typically infrequent or mild and included rare postoperative infections, eyelid contour abnormalities and conjunctival granulomas. Authors' conclusions No trials were designed to evaluate whether the interventions for trichiasis prevent blindness as an outcome; however, several found modest improvement in vision following intervention. Certain interventions have been shown to be more effective at eliminating trichiasis. Full‚Äêthickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the lash‚Äêbearing lid margin was found to be the best technique and is preferably delivered in the community. Surgery may be carried out by an ophthalmologist or a trained ophthalmic assistant. Surgery performed with silk or absorbable sutures gave comparable results. Post‚Äêoperative azithromycin was found to improve outcomes where overall recurrence was low. Plain language summary Interventions for trachomatous trichiasis Review question  This review addressed the question: 'Which interventions improve the results of the treatment for trichiasis (in‚Äêturned eyelashes) caused by trachoma?' Background  Trachoma is the commonest infectious cause of blindness in the world. It is caused by a bacterium called  Chlamydia trachomatis.  This infection causes inflammation and scarring of the surface of the eye, which results in the eyelid turning in (entropion) so that the eyelashes touch the eyeball. This is known as trachomatous trichiasis. The lashes can scratch the corneal surface, leading directly or indirectly (from secondary infections) to corneal opacity. Surgery to correct the eyelid deformity is the main treatment for the late stages of the disease. Most cases of trachomatous trichiasis occur in sub‚ÄêSaharan Africa. They are generally treated by nurses with limited surgical training. Unfortunately the results of the surgery can be quite variable, with frequent post‚Äêoperative trichiasis reported. Therefore, we wanted to find out what types of surgery and other interventions give the best results in treating this condition. Study characteristics  We identified 13 randomised controlled trials. They were all conducted in trachoma‚Äêendemic countries (mostly in sub‚ÄêSaharan Africa) with surgical interventions carried out by non‚Äêphysician surgeons. Five studies compared different surgical treatments. Three studies investigated whether azithromycin antibiotic treatment after surgery improves the results. One study compared different types of sutures. One study compared surgery to the pulling out of eyelashes (epilation). One study compared the outcomes of treatments provided in the community with hospital care. One study compared the results of surgery performed by eye doctors with those of non‚Äêspecialist technicians. The evidence is current to May 2015. Most studies were funded by government research councils or charitable foundations. Key results  These trials suggested that the most effective surgery requires full‚Äêthickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the edge of the eyelid. The use of a surgical lid clamp improves eyelid contour outcomes and reduces granuloma formation. Silk and absorbable sutures give comparable results. The addition of azithromycin treatment at the time of surgery may reduce post‚Äêoperative trichiasis under certain conditions. Epilation is less effective than surgery at treating trichiasis, but has comparable results for vision and corneal change two years after intervention. Community‚Äêbased surgery was more convenient for patients by reducing the time and expense of travelling to a conventional hospital, and it did not increase the risk of complications or recurrence. Surgery performed by ophthalmologists and by integrated eye care workers were both similarly effective. Destroying the lash roots by freezing or electrical ablation appeared to have low success rates and the equipment required is costly and can be difficult to maintain. Quality of the evidence  The quality of the evidence from these randomised controlled trials was variable. Most were of a high quality. However, several were relatively small in size and several had potential bias problems due to the method of randomisation and masking.",Interventions for trachoma trichiasis,Burton and  M; Habtamu and  E; Ho and  D; Gower and  EW,3,2,1,,1
CD003590.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Various methods have been used to try to protect kidney function in patients undergoing surgery. These most often include pharmacological interventions such as dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin‚Äêconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,  N ‚Äêacetyl cysteine (NAC), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin (EPO). Objectives This review is aimed at determining the effectiveness of various measures advocated to protect patients' kidneys during the perioperative period. We considered the following questions: (1) Are any specific measures known to protect kidney function during the perioperative period? (2) Of measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period, does any one method appear to be more effective than the others? (3) Of measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period,does any one method appear to be safer than the others? Search methods In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1966 to August 2012) and EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1988 to August 2012). We originally handsearched six journals ( Anesthesia and Analgesi a,  Anesthesiology ,  Annals of Surgery ,  British Journal of Anaesthesia, Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,  and  Journal of Vascular Surgery)  (1985 to 2004). However, because these journals are properly indexed in MEDLINE, we decided to rely on electronic searches only without handsearching the journals from 2004 onwards. Selection criteria We selected all randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing surgery for which a treatment measure was used for the purpose of providing renal protection during the perioperative period. Data collection and analysis We selected 72 studies for inclusion in this review. Two review authors extracted data from all selected studies and entered them into RevMan 5.1; then the data were appropriately analysed. We performed subgroup analyses for type of intervention, type of surgical procedure and pre‚Äêexisting renal dysfunction. We undertook sensitivity analyses for studies with high and moderately good methodological quality. Main results The updated review included data from 72 studies, comprising a total of 4378 participants. Of these, 2291 received some form of treatment and 2087 acted as controls. The interventions consisted most often of different pharmaceutical agents, such as dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, NAC, ANP, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and EPO or selected hydration fluids. Some clinical heterogeneity and varying risk of bias were noted amongst the studies, although we were able to meaningfully interpret the data. Results showed significant heterogeneity and indicated that most interventions provided no benefit. Data on perioperative mortality were reported in 41 studies and data on acute renal injury in 44 studies (all interventions combined). Because of considerable clinical heterogeneity (different clinical scenarios, as well as considerable methodological variability amongst the studies), we did not perform a meta‚Äêanalysis on the combined data. Subgroup analysis of major interventions and surgical procedures showed no significant influence of interventions on reported mortality and acute renal injury. For the subgroup of participants who had pre‚Äêexisting renal damage, the risk of mortality from 10 trials (959 participants) was estimated as odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.52; the risk of acute renal injury (as reported in the trials) was estimated from 11 trials (979 participants) as OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80. Subgroup analysis of studies that were rated as having low risk of bias revealed that 19 studies reported mortality numbers (1604 participants); OR was 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.90. Fifteen studies reported data on acute renal injury (criteria chosen by the individual studies; 1600 participants); OR was 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97. Authors' conclusions No reliable evidence from the available literature suggests that interventions during surgery can protect the kidneys from damage. However, the criteria used to diagnose acute renal damage varied in many of the older studies selected for inclusion in this review, many of which suffered from poor methodological quality such as insufficient participant numbers and poor definitions of end points such as acute renal failure and acute renal injury. Recent methods of detecting renal damage such as the use of specific biomarkers and better defined criteria for identifying renal damage (RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function and end‚Äêstage renal failure) or AKI (acute kidney injury)) may have to be explored further to determine any possible benefit derived from interventions used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period. Plain language summary No evidence indicates that any of the measures used to protect patients' kidneys during the perioperative period are beneficial The kidneys may be damaged during an operation as a result of direct and indirect insult. The reasons for this are multiple and include changes to physiology brought on by the surgery and by the body‚Äôs response to such insult. Damage to kidneys during the perioperative period is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This updated Cochrane review looked at 72 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 4378 participants (search data until August 2012); interventions most often included pharmacological interventions (administration of dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin‚Äêconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,  N ‚Äêacetyl cysteine, atrial natriuretic peptide, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin) or selected hydration fluids. We attempted to identify any possible damage to the kidneys by evaluating kidney function up to seven days after the operation. No clear evidence from available RCTs suggests that any of the measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period are beneficial. These findings held true in 14 studies of patients with pre‚Äêexisting renal damage and in 24 studies that were considered of good methodological quality. The primary outcomes of these studies were mortality and acute renal injury. Reported mortality in studies with low risk of bias was not different between intervention and control groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.97) or for acute renal injury (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.03). The summary of findings revealed a similar picture. So we conclude that evidence suggests that none of the interventions used currently are helpful in protecting the kidneys during the perioperative period, nor do they cause increased harm.",Interventions for protecting renal function in the perioperative period,Zacharias and  M; Mugawar and  M; Herbison and  GP; Walker and  RJ; Hovhannisyan and  K; Sivalingam and  P; Conlon and  NP,3,2,2,,2
CD006134.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Functional ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. When large, persistent, or painful, these cysts may require operations, sometimes resulting in removal of the ovary. Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s. Objectives This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts. Search methods In March 2014, we searched the databases of CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, and POPLINE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We also examined the reference lists of articles. For the initial review, we wrote to authors of identified trials to seek articles we had missed. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials in any language that included oral contraceptives used for treatment and not prevention of functional ovarian cysts. Criteria for diagnosis of cysts were those used by authors of trials. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently abstracted data from the articles. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy of data entry. For dichotomous outcomes, we computed the Mantel‚ÄêHaenszel odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference with 95% CI. Main results We identified eight randomized controlled trials from four countries; the studies included a total of 686 women. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives did not hasten resolution of functional ovarian cysts in any trial. This held true for cysts that occurred spontaneously as well as those that developed after ovulation induction. Most cysts resolved without treatment within a few cycles; persistent cysts tended to be pathological (e.g., endometrioma or para‚Äêovarian cyst) and not physiological. Authors' conclusions Although widely used for treating functional ovarian cysts, combined oral contraceptives appear to be of no benefit. Watchful waiting for two or three cycles is appropriate. Should cysts persist, surgical management is often indicated. Plain language summary Oral contraceptives to treat cysts of the ovary Women of reproductive age usually release an egg about once a month. The ovary gets an egg from the inside of the ovary to its surface by creating a blister or fluid‚Äêfilled space around the developing egg. When the blister (or cyst) reaches the surface of the ovary, it bursts and releases the egg into the abdominal cavity. After this occurs, the blister can develop into another type of cyst, which makes a hormone (progesterone) that helps the pregnancy to grow. Most of these cysts come and go without problems. Sometimes, however, the cysts get large or painful; others may remain for months. Several decades ago, health care providers learned that women taking birth control pills had fewer cysts, since the pills usually kept an egg from being released. Based on this fact, many clinicians started treating these cysts with birth control pills to make them go away faster. In March 2014, we did a computer search for all randomized controlled trials that studied use of birth control pills to treat these benign (also called functional) cysts. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We found eight trials from four countries; they included 686 women. Three trials included women receiving drugs to help them get pregnant. The other five included women who developed cysts without fertility treatment. In none of these trials did oral contraceptives help the cysts go away faster. Thus, birth control pills should not be used for this purpose. A better approach is waiting two or three months for the cysts to go away on their own.",Oral contraceptives for functional ovarian cysts,Grimes and  DA; Jones and  LB; Lopez and  LM; Schulz and  KF,3,2,2,,3
CD009536.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in selected groups is now performed in England, the USA and Sweden. Patients with aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter are generally considered for elective surgical repair. Patients with aneurysm diameters below or equal to 55 mm (termed 'small AAAs') are managed with aneurysm surveillance as there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend surgery in these cases. As more patients are screened, there will be an increasing number of small AAAs identified. There is interest in pharmaceutical interventions (for example angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antibiotics, beta‚Äêblockers, statins) which could be given to such patients to delay or reverse aneurysm expansion and reduce the need for elective surgical repair. Objectives To assess the effects of medical treatment on the expansion rate of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. Search methods The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‚Äêordinator searched the Specialised Register (May 2012) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 5). Clinical trials databases were searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. The reference lists of articles retrieved by electronic searches were searched for additional citations. Selection criteria We selected randomised trials in which patients with small AAAs allocated to medical treatment with the intention of retarding aneurysm expansion were compared to patients allocated to a placebo treatment, alternative medical treatment, a different regimen of the same drug or imaging surveillance alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta‚Äêanalyses were used when heterogeneity was considered low. The two primary outcomes were the mean difference (MD) in aneurysm diameter and the odds ratio (OR) calculated to compare the number of individuals referred to AAA surgery in each group over the trial period. Main results Seven trials involving 1558 participants were included in this review; 457 were involved in four trials of antibiotic medication, and 1101 were involved in three trials of beta‚Äêblocker medication. Five of the studies were rated at a high risk of bias. Individually, all of the included trials reported non‚Äêsignificant differences in AAA expansion rates between their intervention and control groups. The two major drug groups were then analysed separately. For AAA expansion it was only possible to combine two of the antibiotic trials in a meta‚Äêanalysis. This demonstrated that roxithromycin had a small but significant protective effect (MD ‚Äê0.86 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‚Äê1.57 to ‚Äê0.14). When referral to AAA surgery was compared (including all four antibiotic trials in the meta‚Äêanalysis), non‚Äêsignificantly fewer patients were referred in the intervention groups (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.57) than the control groups. When only the trials reporting actual elective surgery were included in a subgroup analysis, the result remained statistically non‚Äêsignificant (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.57 to 2.42). For the beta‚Äêblocker trials, when all were combined in a meta‚Äêanalysis, there was a very small, non‚Äêsignificant protective effect for propranolol on AAA expansion (MD ‚Äê0.08 mm; 95% CI ‚Äê0.25 to 0.10), and non‚Äêsignificantly fewer patients were referred to AAA surgery in the propranolol group (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05). Bronchospasm and shortness of breath were the main adverse effects from the beta‚Äêblockers. In one trial the adverse effects were reportedly so severe that the trial was stopped early after two years. Authors' conclusions There is some limited evidence that antibiotic medication may have a slight protective effect in retarding the expansion rates of small AAAs. The quality of the evidence makes it unclear whether this translates into fewer referrals to AAA surgery, owing mainly to the small sample sizes of the studies. Antibiotics were generally well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Propranolol was poorly tolerated by patients in all of the beta‚Äêblocker trials and demonstrated only minimal and non‚Äêsignificant protective effects. Further research on beta‚Äêblockers for AAA needs to consider the use of drugs other than propranolol. In general, there is surprisingly little high quality evidence on medical treatment for small AAAs, especially in relation to the use of newer beta‚Äêblockers, ACE inhibitors and statins. Plain language summary Drug treatment for small abdominal aortic aneurysms An aneurysm is an abnormal localised widening (dilatation) of an artery. The most common place for such a dilatation is the abdominal aorta. This is the main artery linking the heart to the lower limbs and the organs of the abdomen, and a dilatation here is termed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). About 4% of men over 55 years of age have an AAA, but it is less common in women. Aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter carry a high risk of rupture, and rupture carries a high risk of death. To reduce the risks, screening programmes using ultrasound scanning have been introduced for selected groups in a number of countries. Patients with aneurysms over 55 mm are then evaluated for elective aneurysm repair. For aneurysms at or below the 55 mm cut‚Äêoff, the current treatment is 'watchful waiting', where the aneurysm is repeatedly scanned over time to see if it is enlarging. This review aimed to identify medical treatments which could slow or even reverse aneurysm growth, and thus delay or avoid the need for elective surgery. We identified seven trials involving 1558 participants where the aneurysm diameters of patients randomised to receive medical treatment were compared to those participants given a control medication or surveillance imaging alone. Four trials studied the effects of antibiotics on slowing aneurysm growth, and showed a small protective effect. Three trials studied the effects of beta‚Äêblockers, and demonstrated a very small protective effect. Notably, the beta‚Äêblocker drugs were associated with a large number of adverse effects. It was unclear whether either drug type delayed referral to aneurysm surgery. The accuracy of the results was limited by the low number of participants (especially important when trying to detect small changes in aneurysm growth rates) and some potentially damaging biases.",Medical treatment for small abdominal aortic aneurysms,Rughani and  G; Robertson and  L; Clarke and  M,3,2,2,no surgery,2
CD006246.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Ovarian carcinosarcoma, also known as malignant mixed Mullerian tumour, is a rare malignant gynaecological tumour constituting about 1% or less of all ovarian cancers. In over 80% of cases, there is extra‚Äêovarian intra‚Äêabdominal spread at diagnosis. The primary treatment has traditionally been surgical cytoreduction followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Regimes have included cisplatin alone; a combination of doxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine, cyclophosphamide, taxol; and various other combinations. The effectiveness of these various regimens appears to be mixed. Therefore, there is a need to clarify if there is an optimum neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy after surgical cytoreduction for this rare tumour. Also, it is important to address quality of life (QoL) issues related to treatment, particularly toxicity, as the overall prognosis appears to be poor. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of various adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy options or chemotherapy alone in combination with surgery in the management of ovarian carcinosarcoma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to February 2012. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of review articles and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or chemotherapy alone, in women with ovarian carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian sarcoma of the ovary). We also reviewed non‚Äêrandomised studies (NRS) for discussion in the absence of RCTs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. No trials were found and therefore no data were analysed. Main results The search strategy identified 297 unique references of which all were excluded. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence to inform decisions about neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens, or chemotherapy alone, for women with ovarian carcinosarcoma .  Ideally, an RCT that is multicentre or multinational, or well designed non‚Äêrandomised studies that use multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline imbalances, are needed to compare treatment modalities and improve current knowledge. Further research in genetic and molecular signalling pathways might improve understanding of this tumour subtype. Plain language summary Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both after surgery for treatment of a rare tumour of the ovary Ovarian carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumour) is a rare malignant gynaecological tumour comprising around 1% or less of all ovarian cancers. These tumours contain both carcinomatous (arising from the epithelial tissue, the tissue that lines the cavities and surfaces of structures throughout the body) and sarcomatous tissue (arising from the connective tissue) within them. This tumour usually presents at an advanced stage and has a poor survival rate despite treatment. It is usually treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy. Various types of chemotherapy drugs have been used to treat the woman before and after surgery (neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings). There is currently no evidence to determine whether any form of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, in combination with surgery is better or worse for prolonging survival and improving quality of life or toxicity. The review highlights the need for good quality studies comparing various chemotherapy regimens, both pre‚Äê and post‚Äêsurgery, with or without radiotherapy. Multicentre, multinational and collaborative good quality studies are needed to investigate this rare disease.",Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in combination with surgery for ovarian carcinosarcoma,Shylasree and  TS; Bryant and  A; Athavale and  R,3,2,2,,2
CD000434.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Fracture of the proximal humerus, often termed shoulder fracture, is a common injury in older people. The management of these fractures varies widely. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2012. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of treatment and rehabilitation interventions for proximal humeral fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases, conference proceedings and bibliographies of trial reports. The full search ended in November 2014. Selection criteria We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials pertinent to the management of proximal humeral fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis Both review authors performed independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Only limited meta‚Äêanalysis was performed. Main results We included 31 heterogeneous RCTs (1941 participants). Most of the 18 separate treatment comparisons were tested by small single‚Äêcentre trials. The main exception was the surgical versus non‚Äêsurgical treatment comparison tested by eight trials. Except for a large multicentre trial, bias in these trials could not be ruled out. The quality of the evidence was either low or very low for all comparisons except the largest comparison. Nine trials evaluated non‚Äêsurgical treatment in mainly minimally displaced fractures. Four trials compared early (usually one week) versus delayed (three or four weeks) mobilisation after fracture but only limited pooling was possible and most of the data were from one trial (86 participants). This found some evidence that early mobilisation resulted in better recovery and less pain in people with mainly minimally displaced fractures. There was evidence of little difference between the two groups in shoulder complications (2/127 early mobilisation versus 3/132 delayed mobilisation; 4 trials) and fracture displacement and non‚Äêunion (2/52 versus 1/54; 2 trials). One quasi‚Äêrandomised trial (28 participants) found the Gilchrist‚Äêtype sling was generally more comfortable than the Desault‚Äêtype sling (body bandage). One trial (48 participants) testing pulsed electromagnetic high‚Äêfrequency energy provided no evidence. Two trials (62 participants) provided evidence indicating little difference in outcome between instruction for home exercises versus supervised physiotherapy. One trial (48 participants) reported, without presentable data, that home exercise alone gave better early and comparable long‚Äêterm results than supervised exercise in a swimming pool plus home exercise. Eight trials, involving 567 older participants, evaluated surgical intervention for displaced fractures. There was high quality evidence of no clinically important difference in patient‚Äêreported shoulder and upper‚Äêlimb function at one‚Äê or two‚Äêyear follow‚Äêup between surgical (primarily locking plate fixation or hemiarthroplasty) and non‚Äêsurgical treatment (sling immobilisation) for the majority of displaced proximal humeral fractures; and moderate quality evidence of no clinically important difference between the two groups in quality of life at two years (and at interim follow‚Äêups at six and 12 months). There was moderate quality evidence of little difference between groups in mortality in the surgery group (17/248 versus 12/248; risk ratio (RR) 1.40 favouring non‚Äêsurgical treatment, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 2.83; P = 0.35; 6 trials); only one death was explicitly linked with the treatment. There was moderate quality evidence of a higher risk of additional surgery in the surgery group (34/262 versus 16/261; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.60; P = 0.01; 7 trials). Although there was moderate evidence of a higher risk of adverse events after surgery, the 95% confidence intervals for adverse events also included the potential for a greater risk of adverse events after non‚Äêsurgical treatment. Different methods of surgical management were tested in 12 trials. One trial (57 participants) comparing two types of locking plate versus a locking nail for treating two‚Äêpart surgical neck fractures found some evidence of slightly better function after plate fixation but also of a higher rate of surgically‚Äêrelated complications. One trial (61 participants) comparing a locking plate versus minimally invasive fixation with distally inserted intramedullary K‚Äêwires found little difference between the two implants at two years. Compared with hemiarthroplasty, one trial (32 participants) found similar results with locking plate fixation in function and re‚Äêoperation rates, whereas another trial (30 participants) reported all five re‚Äêoperations occurred in the tension‚Äêband fixation group. One trial (62 participants) found better patient‚Äêrated (Quick DASH) and composite shoulder function scores at a minimum of two years follow‚Äêup and a lower incidence of re‚Äêoperation and complications after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) compared with hemiarthroplasty. No important between‚Äêgroup differences were found in one trial (120 participants) comparing the deltoid‚Äêsplit approach versus deltopectoral approach for non‚Äêcontact bridging plate fixation, and two trials (180 participants) comparing 'polyaxial' and 'monaxial' screws in locking plate fixation. One trial (68 participants) produced some preliminary evidence that tended to support the use of medial support locking screws in locking plate fixation. One trial (54 participants) found fewer adverse events, including re‚Äêoperations, for the newer of two types of intramedullary nail. One trial (35 participants) found better functional results for one of two types of hemiarthroplasty. One trial (45 participants) found no important effects of tenodesis of the long head of the biceps for people undergoing hemiarthroplasty. Very limited evidence suggested similar outcomes from early versus later mobilisation after either surgical fixation (one trial: 64 participants) or hemiarthroplasty (one trial: 49 participants). Authors' conclusions There is high or moderate quality evidence that, compared with non‚Äêsurgical treatment, surgery does not result in a better outcome at one and two years after injury for people with displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the humeral neck and is likely to result in a greater need for subsequent surgery. The evidence does not cover the treatment of two‚Äêpart tuberosity fractures, fractures in young people, high energy trauma, nor the less common fractures such as fracture dislocations and head splitting fractures. There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to inform the choices between different non‚Äêsurgical, surgical, or rehabilitation interventions for these fractures. Plain language summary Interventions for treating shoulder fractures in adults Background Fracture of the top end of the upper arm bone (proximal humerus) is a common injury in older people. It is often called a shoulder fracture. The bone typically fractures (breaks) just below the shoulder, usually after a fall. Most of these fractures occur without breaking the skin lying over the fracture. The injured arm is often supported in a sling until the fracture heals sufficiently to allow shoulder movement. More severe (displaced) fractures may be treated surgically. This may involve fixing the fracture fragments together by various means. Alternatively, the top of the fractured bone may be replaced (half 'shoulder' replacement: hemiarthroplasty). More rarely, the whole joint, thus including the joint socket, is replaced (total 'shoulder' replacement). Physiotherapy is often used to help restore function. Results of the search We searched medical databases up to November 2014 and included 31 randomised studies with a total of 1941 participants. Most of the 18 treatment comparisons were tested by one study only. The best evidence was from eight studies, one of which was a relatively large multicentre study; these investigated whether surgery gave a better result than non‚Äêsurgical treatment for displaced fractures. Key results Nine trials evaluated non‚Äêsurgical treatment in usually less severe fractures. One trial found a type of arm sling was generally more comfortable than a type of body bandage. There was some evidence that early mobilisation (within one week), compared with delayed mobilisation (after three weeks), resulted in less pain and faster recovery in people with 'stable' fractures. Two studies provided weak evidence that many patients could generally achieve a satisfactory outcome when given sufficient instruction to pursue exercises on their own. Eight studies, involving 567 participants with displaced fractures, compared surgical versus non‚Äêsurgical treatment. Pooled results from the five most recent trials showed that there were no important differences between the two approaches for patient‚Äêreported measures of function and quality of life at 6, 12 and 24 months. There was little difference between the two groups in mortality. Twice as many surgical group patients had additional or secondary surgery. More surgical group patients had adverse events. Twelve trials (744 participants) tested different methods of surgical treatment. There was weak evidence of some differences (e.g. in complications) between some interventions (e.g. different devices or different ways of using devices). There was very limited evidence suggesting similar outcomes for early versus delayed mobilisation after either surgical fixation or hemiarthroplasty. Quality of the evidence Most of the 31 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered that the evidence was either of high or moderate quality for the results of the surgical versus non‚Äêsurgical treatment comparison, which means that we are pretty certain",Interventions for treating proximal humeral fractures in adults,Handoll and  HHG; Brorson and  S,3,3,3,so unclear whether surgery is compared head to head but it says all interventions…,3
CD003278.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Winging of the scapula is caused by weakness of the thoracoscapular muscles, which allows the scapula to lift off the chest wall during shoulder movements. In facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (and occasionally in other muscular dystrophies) there is selective weakness of the thoracoscapular muscles which may spare other shoulder muscles such as the deltoid muscle. This imbalance results in significant winging and loss of shoulder function. Historically, a number of different surgical and non‚Äêsurgical interventions have been used to achieve scapular stability. This review examines the evidence available for the use of all scapular fixation techniques in muscular dystrophy, especially facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Objectives To examine the evidence for the relative efficacy of scapular fixation techniques in muscular dystrophy (especially facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy) in improving upper limb function. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (20 July 2009), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2009) Medline (1966 to July 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2009) for randomised trials. We also contacted authors of trials and other experts in the field. Selection criteria All reports of scapular fixation for muscular dystrophy, including quasi‚Äêrandomised or randomised controlled trials, comparing any form of scapular fixation (surgical and non‚Äêsurgical) in people (of all ages and of all severity) with scapular winging due to muscular dystrophy. Our primary outcome measure was objective improvement in shoulder abduction. Our secondary outcome measures were: patient‚Äêperceived improvement in performance of activities of daily living, cosmetic results, subjective improvement in pain and proportion of patients with significant postoperative complications. Data collection and analysis We collated and summarised studies on the treatment of scapular winging in muscular dystrophy. Main results No randomised trials were identified. We therefore present a review of the non‚Äêrandomised literature available. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the suggestion from observational studies that operative interventions produce significant benefits. However, these have to be balanced against postoperative immobilisation, need for physiotherapy and potential complications. We conclude that a randomised trial would be difficult, but a register of cases and the use of a standardised assessment protocol would allow more accurate comparison of the disparate techniques. Plain language summary Surgical operations for winging of the shoulder blade in muscular dystrophy Winging of the scapula (shoulder blade) in muscular dystrophy is caused by weakness of the muscles which attach the scapula to the chest and help raise the arms. Non‚Äêsurgical interventions involve casts or slings to support the shoulders. Surgical operations involve fixing the scapulae to the ribs using screws or wire. No randomised controlled trials were found. Small case series suggest that surgical operations might produce significant benefits in some people. These need to be balanced against loss of mobility, need for physiotherapy and possible complications including failure of the fixing material or reduced breathing capacity.",Scapular fixation in muscular dystrophy,Orrell and  RW; Copeland and  S; Rose and  MR,3,3,3,surgical and non surgical non surgical are mainly casts…,3
CD012302.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal dilatation of the infradiaphragmatic aorta that is equal to or greater than 30 mm or a local dilatation of equal to or greater than 50% compared to the expected normal diameter of the artery. AAAs rarely occur in individuals under 50 years of age, but thereafter the prevalence dramatically increases with age, with men at a six‚Äêfold greater risk of developing an AAA than women. Prevalence of AAA has been reported to range from 1.3% in women aged 65 to 80 years to between 4% and 7.7% in men aged 65 to 80 years. There is evidence that the risk of rupture increases as the aneurysm diameter increases from 50 mm to 60 mm. People with AAAs over 55 mm in diameter are therefore generally referred for consideration of repair, as the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair. The traditional treatment for AAA is open surgical repair (OSR) which involves a large abdominal incision and is associated with a significant risk of complications. Two less invasive procedures have recently become more widely used:  e ndo v ascular  a neurysm  r epair (EVAR) and laparoscopic repair. EVAR is carried out through sheaths inserted in the femoral artery in the groin: thereafter, a stent graft is placed within the aneurysm sac under radiological image guidance and anchored in place to form a new channel for blood flow. Laparoscopic repair involves the use of a laparoscope which is inserted through small cuts in the abdomen and the synthetic graft is sewn in place to replace the weakened area of the aorta. Laparoscopic AAA repair falls into two categories: hand‚Äêassisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS), where an incision is made to allow the surgeon's hand to assist in the repair; and total laparoscopic surgery (TLS). Both EVAR and laparoscopic repair are favourable over OSR as they are minimally invasive, less painful, associated with fewer complications and lower mortality rate and have a shorter duration of hospital stay. Current evidence suggests that elective laparoscopic AAA repair has a favourable safety profile comparable with that of EVAR, with low conversion rates as well as similar mortality and morbidity rates. As a result, it has been suggested that elective laparoscopic AAA repair may have a role in treating those patients for whom EVAR is unsuitable. Objectives To assess the effects of laparoscopic surgery for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The primary objective of this review was to assess the perioperative mortality and operative time of laparoscopic (total and hand‚Äêassisted) surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) compared to traditional open surgical repair or EVAR. The secondary objective was to assess complication rates, all‚Äêcause mortality (> 30 days), hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, conversion and re‚Äêintervention rates, and quality of life associated with laparoscopic (total and hand‚Äêassisted) surgical repair compared to traditional open surgical repair or EVAR. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2016) and CENTRAL (2016, Issue 7). In addition the CIS searched trials registries for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by electronic searches for additional citations. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials in which patients with an AAA underwent elective laparoscopic repair (total laparoscopic repair or hand‚Äêassisted laparoscopic repair) compared with either open surgical repair or EVAR. Data collection and analysis Studies identified for potential inclusion were independently assessed for inclusion by at least two review authors. Main results One randomised controlled trial with a total of 100 male participants was included in the review. The trial compared hand‚Äêassisted laparoscopic repair with EVAR and provided results for in‚Äêhospital mortality, operative time, length of hospital stay and lower limb ischaemia. The included study did not report on the other pre‚Äêplanned outcomes of this review. No in‚Äêhospital deaths occurred in the study. Hand‚Äêassociated laparoscopic repair was associated with a longer operative time (MD 53.00 minutes, 95% CI 36.49 to 69.51) than EVAR. The incidence of lower limb ischaemia was similar between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 5.34). The mean length of hospital stay was 4.2 days and 3.4 days in the hand‚Äêassisted laparoscopic repair and EVAR groups respectively but standard deviations were not reported and therefore it was not possible to independently test the statistical significance of this result. The quality of evidence was downgraded for imprecision due to the inclusion of one small study; and wide confidence intervals and indirectness due to the study including male participants only. No study compared laparoscopic repair (total or hand‚Äêassisted) with open surgical repair or total laparoscopic surgical repair with EVAR. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic (total and hand‚Äêassisted) surgical repair of AAA versus open surgical repair or EVAR, because only one small randomised trial was eligible for inclusion in this review. High‚Äêquality randomised controlled trials are needed. Plain language summary Laparoscopic surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm Background An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal widening of the abdominal aorta, the main artery supplying blood to the organs in the abdomen and lower part of the body. Between 4% and 7% of men over 65 years of age have an AAA, but it is less common in women. Aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter carry a high risk of rupture which can lead to death; approximately 60% of people with a ruptured AAA die before reaching hospital. People with AAAs over 55 mm are generally referred for repair, as the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair. There are three methods of repairing an AAA: surgery, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and laparoscopic repair. Surgery involves making a large cut in the abdomen, after which the abdominal aorta is exposed and opened and a synthetic graft (tube) is sewn in place to replace the weakened area of the aorta. EVAR involves making a cut in the groin area, after which a stent graft is inserted in collapsed form and opened inside the aneurysm under x‚Äêray guidance and held in place with a stent. Laparoscopic repair or 'keyhole' AAA surgery is carried out by making very small cuts in the patient‚Äôs abdomen, after which a fine telescope (a laparoscope) is inserted through these cuts and the synthetic graft is sewn in place. The benefits of EVAR and laparoscopic repair are that they require smaller incisions, are less painful, have fewer complications, a lower mortality rate and shorter hospital stay than surgical repair. Current evidence suggests that EVAR is the preferred approach for AAA repair. However laparoscopic AAA repair has been suggested as a safe and effective alternative in treating those patients for whom EVAR is unsuitable. This review aimed to assess the effects of laparoscopic surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Study characteristics and key results One randomised controlled trial (current until August 2016), studying 100 male participants and comparing hand‚Äêassisted laparoscopic repair with EVAR, was included in this review. No in‚Äêhospital deaths occurred during the study. The trial showed that hand‚Äêassisted laparoscopic repair took longer to perform than EVAR but there was no difference in the number of patients with reduced blood flow to the leg following either treatment. Quality of evidence At present, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials examining the comparative effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic repair of AAA. The quality of the available evidence was imprecise due to the inclusion of one small study and wide confidence intervals; and indirect because the study includes male participants only.

CD010233.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition and maintenance of remission is a major issue as many patients fail to achieve remission with medical management and require surgical interventions. Purine analogues such as azathioprine (AZA) and 6‚Äêmercaptopurine (6‚ÄêMP) have been used to maintain surgically‚Äêinduced remission in CD, but the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of these agents remains controversial. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of purine analogues (AZA and 6‚ÄêMP) for maintenance of surgically‚Äêinduced remission in CD. Search methods We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 26 July 2018 (and from inception to 31 July 2019). In addition, we searched reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews, conference proceedings and trials registers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of at least three months that enrolled adults and children with surgically‚Äêinduced remission of CD and compared AZA or 6‚ÄêMP to no treatment, placebo or any other active intervention were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The primary outcome was clinical relapse. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic relapse, radiologic and surgical relapse, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawal due to AEs and health‚Äêrelated quality of life. Main results Ten RCTs with a total of 928 participants were included. Study participants were adults recruited from university clinics and gastroenterology hospitals who received interventions post‚Äêsurgery for a duration between 12 to 36 months. Most study participants were recruited less than three months after surgery in all except one study where participants were recruited between 6 to 24 months post‚Äêsurgery. One study was rated as low risk of bias, six studies were rated high risk of bias and three were rated unclear risk of bias. There was moderate certainty evidence that purine analogues are more efficient for preventing clinical relapse than placebo. At 12 to 36 months, 51% (109/215) of AZA/6‚ÄêMP participants relapsed compared to 64% (124/193) of placebo participants (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92; 408 participants; 3 studies; I¬≤ = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence regarding the efficacy of AZA or 6‚ÄêMP for maintaining postoperative clinical remission compared to 5‚ÄêASA compounds was low. At 12 to 24 months , 64% (113/177) of purine analogue participants relapsed compared to 59% (101/170) of 5‚ÄêASA participants (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.24; 347 participants; 4 studies; I¬≤ = 8%; low certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence that purine analogues are inferior for preventing postsurgical clinical relapse compared to tumour necrosis factor alpha agents (anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ±) was very low. At 12 to 24 months, 43% (29/67) of AZA participants relapsed compared to 14% (10/72) of anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ± participants (RR 2.89; 95% CI 1.50 to 5.57; 139 participants; 3 studies; I¬≤ = 0%; very low certainty evidence). The effect of purine analogues compounds on AEs compared to placebo or any active treatment was uncertain, as the quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. After 12 to 24 months, 14% (12/87) of purine analogue participants experienced an AE compared to 10% (8/81) of placebo participants (RR 1.36; 95% CI 0.57 to 3.27; 168 participants; 2 studies; I¬≤ = 0%; low certainty evidence). The effect of purine analogues on AEs compared to 5‚ÄêASA agents was uncertain. After 12 to 24 months, 41% (73/176) of purine analogue participants had an AE compared to 47% (81/171) of 5‚ÄêASA participants (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.07; 346 participants; 4 studies; I¬≤ = 15%; low certainty evidence). The effect of purine analogues on AEs in comparison to anti TNF‚ÄêŒ± agents was uncertain. At 12 to 24 months, 57% (32/56) of AZA participants had an AE compared to 51% (31/61) of anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ± participants (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53; 117 participants; 2 studies; I¬≤ = 0%; low certainty evidence). Purine analogue participants were more like than 5‚ÄêASA participants to have a SAE (RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.13, 311 participants; 3 studies; I¬≤ = 9%; very low certainty evidence), or to withdraw due to an AE (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.81; 425 participants; 5 studies; I¬≤ = 0%; low certainty evidence). Commonly reported AEs across all studies included leucopenia, arthralgia, abdominal pain or severe epigastric intolerance, elevated liver enzymes, nausea and vomiting, pancreatitis, anaemia, nasopharyngitis and flatulence. Authors' conclusions Moderate certainty evidence suggests that AZA and 6‚ÄêMP may be superior to placebo for maintenance of surgically‚Äêinduced remission in participants with CD. There was no clear difference in the number of clinical relapses when purine analogues were compared with 5‚ÄêASA agents, however this is based on low certainty evidence. There was very low certainty evidence that AZA and 6‚ÄêMP are more likely to result in more serious adverse events (SAEs) and withdrawals due to an AE (low certainty) when compared to 5‚ÄêASA agents. Very low certainty evidence suggests that purine analogues may be inferior to anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ± agents, however, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Further research investigating the efficacy and safety of AZA and 6‚ÄêMP in comparison to other active medications in surgically‚Äêinduced remission of CD is warranted. Plain language summary Azathioprine and 6‚Äêmercaptopurine for the maintenance of surgically‚Äêinduced remission in Crohn‚Äôs disease What was the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to understand the benefits and harms of purine analogues (azathioprine (AZA) and 6‚Äêmercaptopurine (6‚ÄêMP)) used for maintaining remission following surgery in people with Crohn's disease (CD). What is Crohn's disease? Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. The disease is known to constantly change from periods when sufferers have symptoms (relapse) to periods when the symptoms disappear (remission) for a short time. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut. However, their symptoms can return after a short time. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease are free from symptoms for as long as possible. However, there are concerns about possible side effects that may arise. Purine analogues (AZA and 6‚ÄêMP) are a group of immunosuppressive drugs which have been used for over five decades to manage Crohn's disease. We researched whether purine antimetabolites can maintain remission in people with Crohn's disease after the diseased portion of their gut has been removed. What are the main results of the review? The review authors found 10 relevant studies with a total of 928 participants, conducted across several European countries, Israel and the US. The studies included people with Crohn's disease over 16 years of age who had undergone surgery and were free from symptoms. These studies compared purine analogues with placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), or oral 5‚Äêaminosalicylic acid (5‚ÄêASA) formulations or with anti‚Äêtumour necrosis factor‚Äêalpha (anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ±) drugs. 5‚ÄêASA and anti‚ÄêTNF‚Äê…ë drugs are used reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut. One study was high quality, while six studies were of lower quality and three studies did not report enough information to make a judgement on quality. Purine analogues are probably better than placebo for maintaining surgically‚Äêinduced remission of Crohn's disease (moderate certainty evidence). The analysis of studies that compared purine antimetabolites to 5‚ÄêASA medications found no difference in the number of people who remained in remission. However, more people who received purine analogues experienced serious side effects or discontinued treatment due to side effects than those who received 5‚ÄêASA (very low and low certainty evidence). The analysis of studies that compared purine analogues to anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ± drugs showed that purine analogues were less effective for maintaining remission of Crohn's disease after surgery. However, the overall certainty of evidence was very low. Well designed studies are needed to better understand the benefits and harms of purine analogues compared with anti‚ÄêTNF‚Äê…ë agents and other active drugs used for Crohn's disease. Due to sparse data and inconsistent reporting across all studies, the effect of purine analogues on side effects compared with placebo, 5‚ÄêASA or biologics was uncertain. Commonly reported side effects across the studies included leucopenia (a reduction in the number of white cells in the blood), pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas), arthralgia (joint pain), abdominal pain or severe epigastric intolerance, elevated liver enzymes, nausea and vomiting, anaemia (low number of red blood cells), nasopharyngitis (common cold) and flatulence (intestinal gas). How up‚Äêto‚Äêdate is this review? The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 31 July 2019. Conclusions There is moderate certainty evidence that AZA and 6‚ÄêMP may be superior to placebo for maintenance of surgically‚Äêinduced remission in participants with Crohn's disease. There was no clear difference in the number of clinical relapses when purine analogues were compared with 5‚ÄêASA agents, however this was based on low certainty evidence. There was very low certainty evidence that AZA and 6‚ÄêMP are more likely to result in more serious side effects and withdrawals due to side effects when compared to 5‚ÄêASA agents. Very low certainty evidence suggests that purine analogues may be inferior to anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ± agents for preventing relapse, however, no firm conclusions can be drawn.

CD008717.PUB3,"Abstract - Background The liver is affected by two of the most common groups of malignant tumours: primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma or other extrahepatic primary cancers. Liver metastases are significantly more common than primary liver cancer, and the reported long‚Äêterm survival rate after radical surgical treatment is approximately 50%. However, R0 resection (resection for cure) is not feasible in the majority of patients; therefore, other treatments have to be considered. One of these is percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), which causes dehydration and necrosis of tumour cells, accompanied by small‚Äêvessel thrombosis, leading to tumour ischaemia and destruction of the tumour. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in people with liver metastases. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 10 September 2019: the Cochrane Hepato‚ÄêBiliary Group Controlled Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; Science Citation Index Expanded; Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‚Äì Science; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We also searched clinical trials registers such as ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (17 September 2019) . Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection and its comparators (no intervention, other ablation methods, systemic treatments) for liver metastases. Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures as outlined by Cochrane. We extracted information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, study design, and trial methods. Two review authors performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using GRADE. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Main results We identified only one randomised clinical trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection (PEI) in addition to transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) versus TACE alone. The trial was conducted in China and included 48 trial participants with liver metastases: 25 received PEI plus TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. The trial included 37 male and 11 female participants. Mean participant age was 49.3 years. Sites of primary tumours included colon (27 cases), stomach (12 cases), pancreas (3 cases), lung (3 cases), breast (2 cases), and ovary (1 case). Seven participants had a single tumour, 15 had two tumours, and 26 had three or more tumours in the liver. The bulk diameter of the tumour on average was 3.9 cm, ranging from 1.2 cm to 7.6 cm. Participants were followed for 10 months to 43 months. The trial reported survival data after one, two, and three years. In the PEI + TACE group, 92%, 80%, and 64% of participants survived after one year, two years, and three years; in the TACE alone group, these percentages were 78.3%, 65.2%, and 47.8%, respectively. Upon conversion of these data to mortality rates, the calculated risk ratio (RR) for mortality at last follow‚Äêup when PEI plus TACE was compared with TACE alone was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.33; very low‚Äêcertainty evidence) after three years of follow‚Äêup. Local recurrence was 16% in the PEI plus TACE group and 39.1% in the TACE group, resulting in an RR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.15; very low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Forty‚Äêfive out of a total of 68 tumours (66.2%) shrunk by at least 25% in the PEI plus TACE group versus 31 out of a total of 64 tumours (48.4%) in the TACE group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but provided very few details. We did not find data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‚Äêrelated quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. The single included trial did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effectiveness of PEI plus TACE versus TACE in people with liver metastases is of very low certainty and is based on one small randomised clinical trial at high risk of bias. Currently, it cannot be determined whether adding PEI to TACE makes a difference in comparison to using TACE alone. Evidence for benefits or harms of PEI compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments is lacking. Plain language summary Percutaneous ethanol injection for liver metastases Is local destruction of the cancer that spread to the liver with percutaneous ethanol injection beneficial? Review question What is the effect of using percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) to destroy any cancer metastases in the liver? Metastases are new cancer sites that are found in parts of the body other than the site of the original cancer. We were looking for any randomised trial (a study in which patients are allocated to groups by a play of chance) assessing effects of PEI in people with metastases in the liver from cancer of any location compared with no PEI with or without co‚Äêinterventions. We looked at effects of PEI on risk of death, progression of disease, health‚Äêrelated quality of life, and adverse events (unwanted effects caused by the intervention). Background When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites of metastasis is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancers affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die of complications. Metastases in the liver can be destroyed by several different methods, one of them being PEI. This procedure is performed under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance; a special needle is placed at the cancer site and is subsequently used to inject alcohol with the goal of killing cancer tissues. Ultrasound and computed tomography are imaging procedures. Alcohol induces tumour destruction by drawing water out of tumour cells (dehydrating them), thereby altering (denaturing) the structure of the cellular proteins. Search results and study characteristics We last searched for evidence on 10 September 2019. We included only one randomised trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE; a liver‚Äêdirected treatment whereby chemotherapy is administered through the catheter directly to blood vessels supplying the tumour) to TACE alone. Forty‚Äêeight people with liver metastases were included; 25 received PEI with TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. Primary tumours were colon, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, and ovary cancers. The included study did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Key results Results of one small randomised clinical trial do not show beneficial or harmful effects of adding percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection to TACE in people with liver metastases with respect to mortality or local recurrence in comparison with TACE alone. Participants were followed for between 10 and 43 months. The tumour necrosis was larger in the combined treatment group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but gave very few details. We found no data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‚Äêrelated quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. Quality of evidence We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty because the identified study was at high risk of bias, had a relatively small sample size, described few events overall, and reported inconclusive results.",Percutaneous ethanol injection for liver metastases,Swierz and  MJ; Storman and  D; Riemsma and  RP; Wolff and  R; Mitus and  JW; Pedziwiatr and  M; Kleijnen and  J; Bala and  MM,3,2,3,other ablation methods makes me a bit sceptical as ablation may or may not be seen as surgical what do you think?,3
CD006212.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Pulmonary emboli (PE), or blood clots in the lungs,can be potentially fatal. Anticoagulation is the first line therapy to prevent PE. In some instances anticoagulation fails to prevent more emboli, or cannot be given because the person has a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena caval filters (VCFs) are metal alloy devices that mechanically trap fragmented emboli from the deep leg veins en route to the pulmonary circulation. Retrievable filters are designed to be introduced and removed percutaneously. Although their deployment seems of theoretical benefit, their clinical efficacy and adverse event profile is unclear. This is the third update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007. Objectives To assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of vena caval filters (VCFs) in preventing pulmonary embolism (PE). Search methods For this review update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (last searched 10 September 2019) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2019, Issue 8) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online. The CIS also searched MEDLINE Ovid, EMBASE Ovid, CINAHL, and AMED (1 January 2017 to 10 September 2019) and trials registries to 10 September 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that examined the efficacy of VCFs in preventing PE. Data collection and analysis For this update, studies were assessed and data extracted independently. We assessed study quality with Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. The outcomes of interest were PE, mortality, lower limb venous thrombosis, filter‚Äêrelated complications and major bleeding. Main results We identified four new studies for this update, bringing the total to six included studies involving 1388 participants. The six studies were clinically heterogeneous and we were unable to carry out meta‚Äêanalysis. Only two studies were considered to be both applicable in current clinical settings and of good methodological quality. One was a randomised open‚Äêlabel trial studying the effect of a retrievable inferior vena caval filter plus anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone on risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) in 399 participants over three months. There was no evidence of a difference in the rates of PE, death, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or bleeding at three and six months after the intervention (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). A filter was inserted in 193 people, but could only be successfully retrieved from 153. Minor filter complications were noted at six months. The second clinically relevant study was a randomised open‚Äêlabel trial of 240 participants who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries, allocated to a filter or no filter, three days after injury, in conjunction with anticoagulation and intermittent pneumatic compression. Prophylactic anticoagulation was initiated in both groups when it was thought safe to do so. There was no evidence of a difference in symptomatic PE, death, or lower limb venous thrombosis rates (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). The only major filter complication was that one person required surgical removal of the filter. We are unable to draw any conclusions from the remaining four included studies. One study showed an increased incidence of long‚Äêterm lower extremity DVT at eight years. Three studies are no longer clinically applicable because they utilised permanent filters which are seldom used now, or they did not use routine prophylactic anticoagulation which is current standard practice. The fourth study compared two filter types and was terminated prematurely as one filter group had a higher rate of thrombosis compared to the other filter type. Authors' conclusions Two of the six identified studies were relevant for current clinical settings. One showed no evidence of a benefit of retrievable filters in acute PE for the outcomes of PE, death, DVT and bleeding during the initial three months in people who can receive anticoagulation (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). The other study did not show any benefit for prophylactic filter insertion in people who sustained multiple traumatic injuries, with respect to symptomatic PE, mortality, or lower extremity venous thrombosis (moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence). We can draw no firm conclusions regarding filter efficacy in the prevention of PE from the remaining four RCTs identified in this review. Further trials are needed to assess vena caval filter effectiveness and safety, and clinical differences between various filter types. Plain language summary Vena caval filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism Background Blood clots in the lungs are called pulmonary emboli. They commonly originate in the leg or pelvic veins, where they can fragment and travel to the lungs via the inferior vena cava (IVC, large vein which carries blood from the lower body to the heart). Further emboli are usually prevented by blood thinning medications (anticoagulants). In some instances (approximately 4% of cases), anticoagulation fails, or it is too dangerous to give anticoagulation. Vena caval filters are metal alloy devices inserted within the IVC to trap blood clots. Modern filters are 'retrievable,' allowing their removal once they are no longer required. However, a number of retrievable filters are not removed. The long‚Äêterm safety profile of these devices is not known. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of vena caval filters. The review authors looked for studies comparing filters with no filter, and studies comparing different filter designs. Study characteristics and key results We included six trials with a total of 1388 participants in the review (current until 10 September 2019). There were too many differences between these studies so we could not combine the results. Two trials were applicable in current clinical settings. One trial showed there is no clear benefit in receiving a retrievable filter for the first three months after an acute PE, for those who can receive anticoagulation, in terms of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), death or bleeding. Not all filters could be removed. Only minor complications from the filters were noted at six months. Another study of people who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries did not show any benefit of inserting a filter three days after injury to prevent PE, or reduce deaths. Preventive anticoagulation and calf compression devices were administered to participants when possible. We are unable to draw any conclusions from the remaining four included studies. This is because three studies are no longer clinically relevant because they utilised permanent filters which are seldom used now, or they did not use routine preventative anticoagulation which is current standard practice. One study showed an increased rate of lower‚Äêextremity DVT in the permanent filter group. The fourth study compared two filter types and was stopped prematurely and thus did not generate sufficient data. Reliability of the evidence Two studies were relevant in current clinical contexts. The evidence presented by both of these studies is of moderate certainty. We reached this assessment because we were not able to combine the data from the studies, and because of the low numbers of participants and events involved. The studies differed in type of participants and clinical situations. There is a further need for trials evaluating the effectiveness of caval filters in people who cannot receive anticoagulation, or when PE occurs despite adequate anticoagulation.",Vena caval filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism,Young and  T; Sriram and  KB,3,2,2,,3
CD005355.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Benign smooth muscle tumours of the uterus, known as fibroids or myomas, are often symptomless. However, about one‚Äêthird of women with fibroids will present with symptoms that are severe enough to warrant treatment. The standard treatment of symptomatic fibroids is hysterectomy (that is surgical removal of the uterus) for women who have completed childbearing, and myomectomy for women who desire future childbearing or simply want to preserve their uterus. Myomectomy, the surgical removal of myomas, can be associated with life‚Äêthreatening bleeding. Excessive bleeding can necessitate emergency blood transfusion. Knowledge of the effectiveness of the interventions to reduce bleeding during myomectomy is essential to enable evidence‚Äêbased clinical decisions. This is an update of the review published in  The Cochrane Library  (2011, Issue 11). Objectives To assess the effectiveness, safety, tolerability and costs of interventions to reduce blood loss during myomectomy. Search methods In June 2014, we conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and trial registers for ongoing and registered trials. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared potential interventions to reduce blood loss during myomectomy to placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis The two authors independently selected RCTs for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included RCTs. The primary review outcomes were blood loss and need for blood transfusion. We expressed study results as mean differences (MD) for continuous data and odds ratios for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results Eighteen RCTs with 1250 participants met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in hospital settings in low, middle and high income countries. Blood loss We found significant reductions in blood loss with the following interventions: vaginal misoprostol (2 RCTs, 89 women: MD ‚Äê97.88 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê125.52 to ‚Äê70.24; I 2  = 43%; moderate‚Äêquality evidence); intramyometrial vasopressin (3 RCTs, 128 women: MD ‚Äê245.87 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê434.58 to ‚Äê57.16; I 2  = 98%; moderate‚Äêquality evidence); intramyometrial bupivacaine plus epinephrine (1 RCT, 60 women: MD ‚Äê68.60 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê93.69 to ‚Äê43.51; low‚Äêquality evidence); intravenous tranexamic acid (1 RCT, 100 women: MD ‚Äê243 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê460.02 to ‚Äê25.98; low‚Äêquality evidence); gelatin‚Äêthrombin matrix (1 RCT, 50 women: MD ‚Äê545.00 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê593.26 to ‚Äê496.74; low‚Äêquality evidence); intravenous ascorbic acid (1 RCT, 102 women: MD ‚Äê411.46 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê502.58 to ‚Äê320.34; low‚Äêquality evidence); vaginal dinoprostone (1 RCT, 108 women: MD ‚Äê131.60 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê253.42 to ‚Äê9.78; low‚Äêquality evidence); loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule (1 RCT, 70 women: MD ‚Äê305.01 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê354.83 to ‚Äê255.19; low‚Äêquality evidence); a fibrin sealant patch (1 RCT, 70 women: MD ‚Äê26.50 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê44.47 to ‚Äê8.53; low‚Äêquality evidence), a Foley catheter tied around the cervix (1 RCT, 93 women: MD ‚Äê240.70 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê359.61 to ‚Äê121.79; low‚Äêquality evidence), and a polyglactin suture round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament (1 RCT, 28 women: MD ‚Äê1870.0 ml, 95% CI ‚Äê2547.16 to 1192.84; low‚Äêquality evidence). There was no good evidence of an effect on blood loss with oxytocin, morcellation or clipping of the uterine artery. Need for blood transfusion We found significant reductions in the need for blood transfusion with vasopressin (2 RCTs, 90 women: OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.74; I 2  = 0%; moderate‚Äêquality evidence); tourniquet tied round the cervix (1 RCT, 98 women: OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.55; low‚Äêquality evidence); tourniquet tied round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament (1 RCT, 28 women: OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23; low‚Äêquality evidence); gelatin‚Äêthrombin matrix (1 RCT, 100 women: OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.10; low‚Äêquality evidence) and dinoprostone (1 RCT, 108 women: OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.81; low‚Äêquality evidence), but no evidence of effect on the need for blood transfusion with misoprostol, oxytocin, tranexamic acid, ascorbic acid, loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule and a fibrin sealant patch. There were insufficient data on the adverse effects and costs of the different interventions. Authors' conclusions At present there is moderate‚Äêquality evidence that misoprostol or vasopressin may reduce bleeding during myomectomy, and low‚Äêquality evidence that bupivacaine plus epinephrine, tranexamic acid, gelatin‚Äêthrombin matrix, ascorbic acid, dinoprostone, loop ligation, a fibrin sealant patch, a peri‚Äêcervical tourniquet or a tourniquet tied round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament may reduce bleeding during myomectomy. There is no evidence that oxytocin, morcellation and temporary clipping of the uterine artery reduce blood loss. Further well designed studies are required to establish the effectiveness, safety and costs of different interventions for reducing blood loss during myomectomy. Plain language summary Interventions to reduce haemorrhage during myomectomy for treating fibroids Background Some women have non‚Äêcancerous growths of the uterus, called fibroids. In a third of cases the fibroids produce symptoms, such as vaginal bleeding, that warrant treatment. The surgical removal of the fibroids, called myomectomy, is one of the treatment options for fibroids. It can be accomplished by either laparotomy (through an incision into the abdomen) or laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). The procedure is associated with heavy bleeding. Many interventions have been used by doctors to reduce bleeding during an operation for removing fibroids but it is unclear whether or not the interventions are effective. Study characteristics The evidence is current to June 2014. The review included 18 studies with a total of 1250 women who had myomectomy for uterine fibroids. All studies compared an intervention to reduce bleeding during myomectomy with either a placebo or no such treatment. Key results The data available suggest that vaginal insertion of misoprostol and infiltration of vasopressin into the uterine muscle are effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. Limited data available also suggest that chemical dissection (such as with mesna), vaginal insertion of dinoprostone, a gelatin‚Äêthrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, infusion of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) during surgery, infiltration of a mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine into the uterine muscles, the use of fibrin sealant patch (a surgical patch that improves blood clotting) or a tourniquet around the cervix or around both the cervix and the infundibulopelvic ligamentmay be effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. We found limited information on the harms (adverse effects) of the different interventions. Quality of the evidence There is moderate‚Äêquality evidence that misoprostol reduces blood loss by between 70.24 ml and 125.52 ml; with a laparotomy vasopressin reduces blood loss by between 392.51 and 507.49 ml during myomectomy, and by between 121.73 ml and 172.17 ml during laparoscopic myomectomy. There is low‚Äêquality evidence for the rest of the interventions (chemical dissection, dinoprostone, gelatin‚Äêthrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, vitamin C, mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine, a fibrin sealant patch and the two types of tourniquet).",Interventions to reduce haemorrhage during myomectomy for fibroids,Kongnyuy and  EJ; Wiysonge and  CS,3,2,2,,2
CD012019,"Abstract - Background About 10% of reproductive‚Äêaged women suffer from endometriosis which is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the 'gold standard' diagnostic test for endometriosis, but it is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no simple non‚Äêinvasive or minimally‚Äêinvasive tests available in clinical practice that accurately diagnoses endometriosis. Objectives 1. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of urinary biomarkers for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. 2. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses. Urinary biomarkers were evaluated as replacement tests for surgical diagnosis and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis. Search methods The searches were not restricted to particular study design, language or publication dates. We searched the following databases to 20 April ‚Äê 31 July 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP and ClinicalTrials.gov (trial register). MEDION, DARE, and PubMed were also searched to identify reviews and guidelines as reference sources of potentially relevant studies. Recently published papers not yet indexed in the major databases were also sought. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstract, text words across the record and the medical subject headings (MeSH) and was modified for each database. Selection criteria Published peer‚Äêreviewed, randomised controlled or cross‚Äêsectional studies of any size were considered, which included prospectively collected samples from any population of reproductive‚Äêaged women suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more urinary biomarkers with surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of the data from each study. For each diagnostic test, the data were classified as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. The bivariate model was used to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data sets were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful urine test to replace diagnostic surgery was one with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 79% to detect endometriosis. The criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity of equal or greater than 95% and specificity of equal or greater than 50%, which in case of negative result rules out the diagnosis (SnOUT test) or sensitivity of equal or greater than 50% with specificity of equal or greater than 95%, which in case of positive result rules the diagnosis in (SpIN test). Main results We included eight studies involving 646 participants, most of which were of poor methodological quality. The urinary biomarkers were evaluated either in a specific phase of menstrual cycle or irrespective of the cycle phase. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of four urinary biomarkers for endometriosis, including three biomarkers distinguishing women with and without endometriosis (enolase 1 (NNE); vitamin D binding protein (VDBP); and urinary peptide profiling); and one biomarker (cytokeratin 19 (CK 19)) showing no significant difference between the two groups. All of these biomarkers were assessed in small individual studies and could not be statistically evaluated in a meaningful way. None of the biomarkers met the criteria for a replacement test or a triage test. Three studies evaluated three biomarkers that did not differentiate women with endometriosis from disease‚Äêfree controls. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use as a replacement or triage test in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Several urinary biomarkers may have diagnostic potential, but require further evaluation before being introduced into routine clinical practice. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, and diagnosis of endometriosis using urinary biomarkers should only be undertaken in a research setting. Plain language summary Urinary biomarkers for the non‚Äêinvasive diagnosis of endometriosis Review Question How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? Background Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‚Äêinvasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‚Äêinvasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. Study characteristics The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‚Äêaged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. Key results None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Quality of the evidence Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. Future research More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis.",Urinary biomarkers for the non‚Äêinvasive diagnosis of endometriosis,Liu and  E; Nisenblat and  V; Farquhar and  C; Fraser and  I; Bossuyt and  PMM; Johnson and  N; Hull and  ML,3,2,2,,2
CD011650.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is classified in many ways. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group staging classifies the cancer based on patient's life expectancy. People with very early‚Äê or early‚Äêstage hepatocellular carcinoma have single tumour or three tumours of maximum diameter of 3 cm or less, Child‚ÄêPugh status A to B, and performance status 0 (fully functional). Management of hepatocellular carcinoma is uncertain. Objectives To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of early or very early hepatocellular carcinoma through a network meta‚Äêanalysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‚Äêanalysis and instead assessed the benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other or versus sham or no intervention using standard Cochrane methodology. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on hepatocellular carcinoma. Selection criteria We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with very early‚Äê or early‚Äêstage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, size and number of the tumours, and future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials including participants who were previously liver transplanted. We considered interventions compared with each other, sham, or no intervention. Data collection and analysis We calculated the odds ratio, mean difference, rate ratio, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both fixed‚Äêeffect and random‚Äêeffects models based on available‚Äêparticipant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed the risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four trials (593 participants; 574 participants included for one or more analyses) compared surgery versus radiofrequency ablation in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, eligible to undergo surgery. Fourteen trials (2533 participants; 2494 participants included for various analyses) compared different non‚Äêsurgical interventions in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, not eligible to undergo surgery. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes for both comparisons. Surgery versus radiofrequency ablation The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral aetiology. The trials did not report the participants' portal hypertension status or whether they received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. The average follow‚Äêup ranged from 29 months to 42 months (3 trials). There was no evidence of a difference in all‚Äêcause mortality at maximal follow‚Äêup for surgery versus radiofrequency ablation (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.08; 574 participants; 4 trials; I 2  = 68). Cancer‚Äêrelated mortality was lower in the surgery group (20/115 (17.4%)) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (43/115 (37.4%)) (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65; 230 participants; 1 trial). Serious adverse events (number of participants) was higher in the surgery group (14/60 (23.3%)) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (1/60 (1.7%)) (odds ratio 17.96, 95% CI 2.28 to 141.60; 120 participants; 1 trial). The number of serious adverse events was higher in the surgery group (adjusted rate 11.3 events per 100 participants) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (3/186 (1.6 events per 100 participants)) (rate ratio 7.02, 95% CI 2.29 to 21.46; 391 participants; 2 trials; I 2  = 0%). None of the trials reported health‚Äêrelated quality of life. One trial was funded by a party with vested interests; three trials were funded by parties without any vested. Non‚Äêsurgical interventions The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral aetiology. Most trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants, and none of the trials reported whether the participants received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. The average follow‚Äêup ranged from 6 months to 37 months (11 trials). Trial participants, who were not eligible for surgery, were treated with radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation, microwave ablation, percutaneous acetic acid injection, percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of radiofrequency ablation with systemic chemotherapy, a combination of radiofrequency ablation with percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation with percutaneous alcohol injection, or a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation with radiofrequency ablation. The mortality at maximal follow‚Äêup was higher in the percutaneous acetic acid injection (hazard ratio 1.77, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.79; 125 participants; 1 trial) and percutaneous alcohol injection (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.88; 882 participants; 5 trials; I 2  = 57%) groups compared with the radiofrequency ablation group. There was no evidence of a difference in all‚Äêcause mortality at maximal follow‚Äêup for any of the other comparisons. The proportion of people with cancer‚Äêrelated mortality at maximal follow‚Äêup was higher in the percutaneous alcohol injection group (adjusted proportion 16.8%) compared with the radiofrequency ablation group (20/232 (8.6%)) (odds ratio 2.18, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.89; 458 participants; 3 trials; I 2  = 0%). There was no evidence of a difference in any of the comparisons that reported serious adverse events (number of participants or number of events). None of the trials reported health‚Äêrelated quality of life. Five trials were funded by parties without any vested interest; the source of funding was not available in the remaining trials. Authors' conclusions The evidence was of low or very low quality. There was no evidence of a difference in all‚Äêcause mortality at maximal follow‚Äêup between surgery and radiofrequency ablation in people eligible for surgery. All‚Äêcause mortality at maximal follow‚Äêup was higher with percutaneous acetic acid injection and percutaneous alcohol injection than with radiofrequency ablation in people not eligible for surgery. There was no evidence of a difference in all‚Äêcause mortality at maximal follow‚Äêup for the other comparisons. High‚Äêquality RCTs designed to assess clinically important differences in all‚Äêcause mortality and health‚Äêrelated quality of life, and having an adequate follow‚Äêup period (approximately five years) are needed. Plain language summary Treatment of very early‚Äê or early‚Äêstage primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) arises from the liver cells and is distinct from cancer arising from other parts of the body and spreading to the liver. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group staging classifies cancer based on patient's life expectancy. It is broadly based on the size of the cancer, number of cancers in the liver, how well the liver functions, and whether one's activities are affected by the cancer. People with very early‚Äê or early‚Äêstage hepatocellular carcinoma have single cancer or multiple small cancers confined to the liver, have good liver function, and no restriction of activities. There is significant uncertainty in the management of early‚Äêstage hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we searched literature databases for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on the topic until September 2016. We excluded trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time, we planned to use advanced methods described in full in the review. Study characteristics of included trials Four trials (593 participants; 574 participants included for one or more analyses) compared surgery (removal of part of the liver containing cancer) versus radiofrequency ablation (cancer destruction using heat generated by electric current) in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, eligible to undergo surgery; and 14 trials (2533 participants; 2494 participants included for various analyses) compared different non‚Äêsurgical interventions in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, not eligible to undergo surgery. Key results Surgery versus radiofrequency ablation The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral cause. The trials did not report the participants' portal hypertension status or whether they received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. Three trials reported average follow‚Äêup (range 29 months to 42 months). One trial was funded by a party with vested interests; three trials were funded by parties without any vested.. In people eligible for surgery, there was no evidence of a difference in death between radiofrequency ablation and surgery; although there were fewer deaths due to cancer in the surgery group. There were more serious complications in the the surgery group than in the radiofrequency ablation group. None of the trials reported health‚Äêrelated quality of life. Non‚Äêsurgical interventions The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral cause. Most trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants, and none reported whether the participants received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy.

CD001081.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long‚Äêterm disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of a Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2017. Objectives To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone, in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non‚Äêdisabling stroke). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal to October 2019. We also reviewed the reference lists of all relevant studies and abstract books from research proceedings. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carotid artery surgery plus best medical treatment with best medical treatment alone.  Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. We assessed the results and the quality of the evidence of the primary and secondary outcomes by the GRADE method, which classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. Main results We included three trials involving 6343 participants. The trials differed in the methods of measuring carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke. Using the primary electronic data files, we pooled and analysed individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient‚Äêyears of follow‚Äêup), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials, and redefining outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. Surgery increased the five‚Äêyear risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with less than 30% stenosis (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.56; 2 studies, 1746 participants; high‚Äêquality evidence). Surgery decreased the five‚Äêyear risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19; 2 studies, 1429 participants; high‚Äêquality evidence), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94; 3 studies, 1549 participants; moderate‚Äêquality evidence), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near‚Äêocclusion (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.67; 3 studies, 1095 participants; moderate‚Äêquality evidence). However, surgery decreased the five‚Äêyear risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with near‚Äêocclusions (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.53; 2 studies, 271 participants; moderate‚Äêquality evidence). Authors' conclusions Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of recurrent stroke for people with significant stenosis. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate‚Äêquality evidence) and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis (moderate‚Äêquality evidence). Plain language summary Carotid surgery in people who have symptoms with narrowing of the carotid artery Question What are the benefits of surgical removal of the fatty deposits and blood clots from inside the carotid artery wall (carotid endarterectomy) for people who have recently (within four to six months) had symptoms due to carotid stenosis (narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to the brain)? Background Strokes cause long‚Äêterm disability and death. The chances of dying from the first stroke are 15% to 35%, and increase to 69% in subsequent strokes, which often occur within one year of the first attack. Carotid endarterectomy may reduce the risk of subsequent or recurrent stroke, but carries a risk of complications immediately before, after, and during the operation, including disabling stroke and death. There is a 7% risk of stroke and death within 30 days of endarterectomy. Search date We searched for studies to 23 October 2019. Study characteristics This review identified three randomised controlled trials (6343 participants randomised), which compared carotid surgery with no carotid surgery (i.e. best medical therapy plus surgery versus best medical therapy alone) in participants with carotid stenosis and recent transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), or minor ischaemic strokes in the territory of that artery. The trials were carried out in centres in Europe, USA, Canada, Israel, South Africa, and Australia. The gender ratio of participants was 2.6:1 (72% men and 28% women); 90% of participants were younger than 75 years old. The results of the three trials were initially conflicting, because they differed in how they measured carotid stenosis and how they defined the outcomes. To address this discrepancy, we reassessed the original patient data using the same methods and definitions, so results could be compared. Key results Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of further stroke for people with significant stenosis. Results were particularly striking for older people, male participants, those with a significant stenosis (70% to 99%), and those who were operated on within two weeks of their TIA or stroke. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% stenosis. We did not find any benefit of carotid surgery for those in whom the stenosis was minor (less than 50%) or where the carotid artery was almost blocked (near occlusion). Quality of the evidence The evidence was of moderate or high quality for all the results. Therefore, we can be moderately or very confident in the results.",Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis,Rerkasem and  A; Orrapin and  S; Howard and  DPJ; Rerkasem and  K,3,2,3,best medical management,3
CD010244.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer. Resection of the cancer is the only treatment with the potential to achieve long‚Äêterm survival. However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving adjacent structures such as blood vessels which are not usually removed because of fear of increased complications after surgery. Such patients often receive palliative treatment. Resection of the pancreas along with the involved vessels is an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus palliative treatment in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trial registers until February 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing pancreatic resection versus palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (irrespective of language or publication status). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed‚Äêeffect and random‚Äêeffects models using Review Manager (RevMan). We calculated the hazard ratio (HR), risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on an intention‚Äêto‚Äêtreat analysis. Main results We identified two trials comparing pancreatic resection versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Ninety eight patients were randomised to pancreatic resection (n = 47) or palliative treatment (n = 51) in the two trials included in this review. Both trials were at high risk of bias. Both trials included patients who had locally advanced pancreatic cancer which involved the serosa anteriorly or retroperitoneum posteriorly or involved the blood vessels. Such pancreatic cancers would be considered generally unresectable. One trial included patients with pancreatic cancer in different locations of the pancreas including the head, neck and body (n = 42). The patients allocated to the pancreatic resection group underwent partial pancreatic resection (pancreatoduodenectomy with lymph node clearance or distal pancreatic resection with lymph node clearance) in this trial; the control group received palliative treatment with chemoradiotherapy. In the other trial, only patients with cancer in the head or neck of the pancreas were included (n = 56). The patients allocated to the pancreatic resection group underwent en bloc total pancreatectomy with splenectomy and vascular reconstruction in this trial; the control group underwent palliative bypass surgery with chemoimmunotherapy. The pancreatic resection group had lower mortality than the palliative treatment group (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58, very low quality evidence). Both trials followed the survivors up to at least five years. There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group in either trial. Approximately 40% of the patients who underwent pancreatic resection were alive in the pancreatic resection group at the end of three years. This difference in survival was statistically significant (RR 22.68; 95% CI 3.15 to 163.22). The difference persisted at five years of follow‚Äêup (RR 8.65; 95% CI 1.12 to 66.89). Neither trial reported severe adverse events but it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from severe adverse events in both groups. The overall peri‚Äêoperative mortality in the resection group in the two trials was 2.5%. None of the trials reported quality of life. The estimated difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of the patient related to the treatment) between the two groups was imprecise (MD ‚Äê23.00 days; 95% CI ‚Äê59.05 to 13.05, very low quality evidence). The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the pancreatic resection group than the palliative treatment group (MD ‚Äê10.70 thousand USD; 95% CI ‚Äê14.11 to ‚Äê7.29, very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is very low quality evidence that pancreatic resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and venous involvement. When sufficient expertise is available, pancreatic resection could be considered for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased morbidity associated with the procedure. Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to increase confidence in the estimate of effect and to assess the quality of life of patients and the cost‚Äêeffectiveness of pancreatic resection versus palliative treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Plain language summary Surgical removal of part of the pancreas and other tissues versus other treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer which invades the surrounding structures Background The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen which secretes digestive juices for the digestion of food. It also harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain the blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer. Surgery to remove the cancer improves survival. However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving major blood vessels which are not usually removed because of the fear of increased complications after surgery. Such patients receive palliative treatment. Resection (removing part of an organ) of the pancreas has been suggested as an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, in this group of patients the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus other treatments are not clear. We set out to answer this question by performing a thorough search of the literature for studies which compared surgical removal with palliative treatments. We included only randomised controlled trials, studies which, if designed appropriately, can help avoid arriving at wrong conclusions. We searched the literature for all studies reported until December 2013. Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data to minimise errors. Characteristics of studies We identified two trials comparing surgical removal of the pancreas versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Ninety eight patients were included in these two trials. Forty seven patients received surgery while the remaining patients received palliative treatment. The choice of who received surgery and who received other treatments was decided by a method similar to the toss of a fair coin. Main results Approximately 97% of patients who underwent cancer removal surgery survived the surgery in the two trials. The patients who received surgery were twice as likely to live as those who received other treatments. The survivors were followed until at least five years. There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group while approximately 40% of the patients who underwent surgical removal were alive at the end of three years. This difference in survival was statistically significant. The studies did not report the complications related to surgery although it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from complications in both groups. None of the trials reported quality of life. There was no evidence of any difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of a patient related to the treatment) between the two groups. The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the surgical removal group (by about USD 10,000) than in the palliative treatment group in the trial conducted in Japan. There was no information about the costs in the other trial, which was conducted in Greece. Quality of evidence Overall, the trials were at high risk of bias (that is, there is a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions). This was because it was not clear how the randomisation was performed, whether the people assessing the outcomes were aware of the group to which the participants belonged, and whether all participants were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was very low as the trials were at high risk of bias and there were few trials to assess whether only studies with negative results were published. Conclusions There is very low quality evidence that surgical resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with involvement of veins. In selected patients pancreatic resection could be considered for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased complications associated with the surgical procedure and when sufficient expertise is available. Future research Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to obtain more precise results and to assess the quality of life of patients and the value for money of surgical removal versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.",Resection versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer,Gurusamy and  KS; Kumar and  S; Davidson and  BR; Fusai and  G,3,3,3,,3
CD012432.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Medication‚Äêrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some individuals to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab and antiangiogenic agents) and involves the progressive destruction of bone in the mandible or maxilla. Depending on the drug, its dosage, and the duration of exposure, the occurrence of this adverse drug reaction may be rare (e.g. following the oral administration of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatments for osteoporosis, or antiangiogenic agent‚Äêtargeted cancer treatment) or common (e.g. following intravenous bisphosphonate for cancer treatment). MRONJ is associated with significant morbidity, adversely affects quality of life (QoL), and is challenging to treat. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs. To assess the effects of non‚Äêsurgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health‚Äôs Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health‚Äôs Trials Register (to 23 November 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 23 November 2016), and Embase Ovid (23 May 2016 to 23 November 2016). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry ( ClinicalTrials.gov ) and the  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on language or publication status when searching the electronic databases; however, the search of Embase was restricted to the last six months due to the Cochrane Embase Project to identify all clinical trials and add them to CENTRAL. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time‚Äêto‚Äêevent, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included five RCTs (1218 participants) in the review. Three trials focused on the prophylaxis of MRONJ. Two trials investigated options for the treatment of established MRONJ. The RCTs included only participants treated with bisphosphonates and, thus, did not cover the entire spectrum of medications associated with MRONJ. Prophylaxis of MRONJ One trial compared standard care with regular dental examinations in three‚Äêmonth intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ: RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39 (253 participants; low‚Äêquality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated. As dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ, one trial investigated the effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) for preventing MRONJ in people with cancer undergoing dental extractions. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of PRGF on MRONJ incidence when compared with standard treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51; 176 participants; very low‚Äêquality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported. In another trial comparing wound closure by primary intention with wound closure by secondary intention after dental extractions in people treated with oral bisphosphonates (700 participants), no cases of intraoperative complications or postoperative MRONJ were observed. QoL was not investigated. Treatment of MRONJ One trial analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone. HBO in addition to standard care did not significantly improve healing from MRONJ compared with standard care alone (at last follow‚Äêup: RR 1.56; 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18; 46 participants included in the analysis; very low‚Äêquality evidence). QoL data were presented qualitatively as intragroup comparisons; hence, an effect estimate of treatment on QoL was not possible. Other secondary outcomes were not reported. The other RCT found no significant difference between autofluorescence‚Äê and tetracycline fluorescence‚Äêguided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ at any timepoint (at one‚Äêyear follow‚Äêup: RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; 34 participants included in the analysis; very low‚Äêquality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported. Authors' conclusions Prophylaxis of MRONJ One open‚Äêlabel RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations in three‚Äêmonth intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of MRONJ in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low. There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of either of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ (i.e. PRGF inserted into the postextraction alveolus during dental extractions, and wound closure by primary or secondary intention after dental extractions). Treatment of MRONJ Available evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit for hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an adjunct to conventional therapy. There is also insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about autofluorescence‚Äêguided versus tetracycline fluorescence‚Äêguided bone surgery. Plain language summary Interventions for managing medication‚Äêrelated osteonecrosis (severe bone damage) of the jaw Review question What are the effects of different interventions to either prevent or treat medication‚Äêrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw compared with each other or compared with no treatment or an inactive intervention ('placebo')? Background Medication‚Äêrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is severe bone damage in the jaw bone that occurs in some people as an adverse reaction to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile). It is a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. MRONJ occurs rarely in people taking some medicines for osteoporosis. However, in people receiving these drugs at higher doses for cancer‚Äêrelated conditions, the risk of MRONJ may be higher and has been reported to occur in up to 5 in 100 individuals. It is essential to obtain better treatments for people who have MRONJ. It is also important to identify effective preventive measures to reduce the risk of MRONJ. Study characteristics Working with  Cochrane Oral Health , we searched for studies that had been published up to November 2016. We found three studies that focused on the prevention of MRONJ and two studies that tested treatments for MRONJ. The studies involved 1218 adults, with the smallest study having 40 participants and the largest study having 700 participants. Most study participants were women, but one study was of men with prostate cancer receiving bisphosphonate infusions (given by drip into a vein). All studies included only participants treated with bisphosphonates (used to support treatment and reduce risk of fracture and bone pain), although several other drugs are also known to induce MRONJ. Key results One study provided low‚Äêquality evidence that dental examinations at three‚Äêmonth intervals and preventive treatments (antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) are more effective than standard care for reducing the number of cases with MRONJ in a group of people receiving intravenous bisphosphonates for cancer‚Äêrelated conditions. In the experimental group (which received preventive care consisting of antibiotics and specific wound closure), fewer people developed MRONJ (2 participants per 100 who underwent close monitoring) compared with the control group (23 participants per 100 who had standard care). There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the use of the other interventions investigated would reduce the risk of MRONJ or would improve healing of MRONJ. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was low or very low. This was due to limitations in how the studies were designed and run. For example, some participants changed groups during the study, some participants did not finish the study, and the outcomes were measured at different follow‚Äêup times.",Interventions for managing medication‚Äêrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw,Beth‚ÄêTasdogan and  NH; Mayer and  B; Hussein and  H; Zolk and  O,3,2,1,include since it's surgical and non surgical,1
CD010260.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Cervical cancer is the second commonest cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. Sources suggest that a very high proportion of new cervical cancer cases in developing countries are at an advanced stage (IB2 or more) and more than a half of these may be stage III or IV. Cervical cancer staging is based on findings from clinical examination (FIGO) staging). Standard care in Europe and US for stage IB2 to III is non‚Äêsurgical treatment (chemoradiation). However in developing countries, where there is limited access to radiotherapy, locally advanced cervical cancer may be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and hysterectomy (surgery to remove the womb and the neck of the womb, with or without the surrounding tissues). It is not certain if this improves survival. Therefore, it is important to systematically assess the value of hysterectomy in addition to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both, as an alternative intervention in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IB2 to III). Objectives To determine whether hysterectomy, in addition to standard treatment with radiation or chemotherapy, or both, in women with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IB2 to III) is safe and effective compared with standard treatment alone. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS up to February 2014. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment protocols involving hysterectomy versus radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both, in women with advanced stage (IB2 to III) cervical cancer presenting for the first time. Data collection and analysis We assessed study eligibility independently, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, overall and progression or disease‚Äêfree survival outcomes were synthesised in a meta‚Äêanalysis using the random‚Äêeffects model. Adverse events were incompletely reported so results of single trials were described in narrative form. Main results We included seven RCTs (1217 women) of varying methodological quality in the review; most trials were at moderate or high risk of bias. Three were multi‚Äêcentre trials, two were single‚Äêcentre trials, and in two trials it was unclear if they were single or multi‚Äêcentre. These trials compared the following interventions for women with locally advanced cervical cancer (stages IB2 to III): hysterectomy (simple or radical) with radiotherapy (N = 194) versus radiotherapy alone (N = 180); hysterectomy (simple or radical) with chemoradiotherapy (N = 31) versus chemoradiotherapy alone (N = 30); hysterectomy (radical) with chemoradiotherapy (N = 111) versus internal radiotherapy with chemoradiotherapy (N = 100); hysterectomy (simple or radical) with upfront (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy (N = 298) versus radiotherapy alone (N = 273). One trial (N = 256) found no difference in the risk of death or disease progression between women who received attenuated radiotherapy followed by hysterectomy and those who received radiotherapy (external and internal) alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.29). This trial also reported no difference between the two groups in terms of adverse effects (18/129 grade 3 or 4 adverse effects in the hysterectomy and radiation group and 19 cases in 18/121 women in the radiotherapy alone group). There was no difference in 5‚Äêyear tumour‚Äêfree actuarial survival (representation of the probable years of survivorship of a defined population of participants) or severe complications (grade 3) in another trial (N = 118) which reported the same comparison (6/62 versus 6/56 in the radiation with surgery group versus the radiotherapy alone group, respectively). The quality of the evidence was low for all these outcomes. One trial (N = 61) reported no difference (P value > 0.10) in overall and recurrence‚Äêfree survival at 3 years between chemoradiotherapy and hysterectomy versus chemoradiotherapy alone (low quality evidence). Adverse events and morbidity data were not reported. Similarly, another trial (N = 211) found no difference in the risk of death (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.21, P value = 0.19, low quality evidence), disease progression (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.34, P value = 0.24, low quality evidence) or severe late complications (P value = 0.53, low quality evidence) between women who received internal radiotherapy versus hysterectomy after both groups had received external‚Äêbeam chemoradiotherapy. Meta analysis of three trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone, assessing 571 participants, found that women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus hysterectomy had less risk of death than those who received radiotherapy alone (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93, I 2  = 0%, moderate quality evidence). However, a significant number of the participants that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus hysterectomy had radiotherapy as well. There was no difference in the proportion of women with disease progression or recurrence between the two groups (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.05, I 2  = 20%, moderate quality evidence). Results of single trials reported no apparent (P value > 0.05) difference in long‚Äêterm severe complications, grade 3 acute toxicity and severe late toxicity between the two groups (low quality evidence). Quality of life outcomes were not reported in any of the trials. Authors' conclusions From the available RCTs, we found insufficient evidence that hysterectomy with radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, improves the survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer who are treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. The overall quality of the evidence was variable across the different outcomes and was universally downgraded due to concerns about risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone for survival outcomes was moderate, with evidence from other comparisons of low quality. This was mainly based on poor reporting and sparseness of data where results were based on single trials. More trials that assess medical management with and without hysterectomy may test the robustness of the findings of this review as further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. Plain language summary Hysterectomy with medical management for cervical cancer that has spread to nearby tissues only The issue    Cancer of the neck of the womb (cervical cancer) is the commonest cancer among women up to 65 years of age. A high proportion of women in developing countries are diagnosed with locally advanced disease (spread to nearby tissues, but no obvious distant spread). They are usually treated with radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy (medical treatment). Hysterectomy (surgery to remove the womb and the cervix) with medical treatment is also used, especially in developing countries where access to radiotherapy is limited. The aim of the review    Is hysterectomy with medical treatment more beneficial compared to medical treatment alone in locally advanced cervical cancer? How was the review conducted?    A  literature search from 1966 to February 2014 identified seven trials at moderate to high risk of bias. These included 1217 women and compared: hysterectomy with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone; hysterectomy with chemoradiotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy alone; hysterectomy with chemoradiotherapy versus internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) with chemoradiotherapy; and hysterectomy with upfront (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. What are the main findings?    Two studies, including 374 women, compared preoperative radiotherapy and hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone, but only one trial reported overall survival, with no difference between the groups. These studies found no difference in the risk of disease progression (or death) or five‚Äêyear tumour‚Äêfree survival. One study, including 61 women, reported no difference in overall and recurrence‚Äêfree survival between chemotherapy and hysterectomy versus chemoradiotherapy alone. Another study comparing internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) versus hysterectomy in 211 women who received chemoradiotherapy found no difference in the risk of death or disease progression. By combining results from three of the independent studies that assessed 571 women, we found that fewer women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus hysterectomy died than those who received radiotherapy alone. However, many women in the first group also had radiotherapy. There was no difference in the number of women who were disease‚Äêfree after treatment. Adverse events were incompletely reported. Results of single trials showed no differences in severe adverse events between the two groups in any comparison. Limited data suggested that the interventions appeared to be reasonably well tolerated, although more evidence is needed. Quality of life measures were not reported. What are the conclusions?    We found insufficient evidence that hysterectomy added to radiation and chemoradiation improved survival, quality of life or adverse events in locally advanced cervical cancer compared with medical treatment alone. Overall, the quality of the evidence was variable and was universally downgraded due to concerns about risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone for survival outcomes was moderate, with evidence from other comparisons being of low quality.

CD010517.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of Œ≤‚Äêthalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life‚Äêlong blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with Œ≤‚Äêthalassaemia major or intermedia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018). Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled and quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio‚Äêfrequency). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post‚Äêoperative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low‚Äêquality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra‚Äêoperative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low‚Äêquality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post‚Äêoperative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03). Authors' conclusions The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long‚Äêterm effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well‚Äêconducted observational studies may be used to answer this question. Plain language summary Removal of the spleen in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia Review question We reviewed the evidence comparing the removal of the spleen (splenectomy) to other treatments (such as blood transfusions and chelation (removal of excess iron) in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia. Background Thalassaemia is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in production of haemoglobin ‚Äê which carries oxygen in red blood cells to all the tissues of the body. The clinical presentation of thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form to being dependant on life long blood transfusions. The genetic defect in thalassaemia also results in formation of ineffective red blood cells, which are removed by the spleen which in turn becomes enlarged. Removing the spleen can lengthen the lifespan of red blood cells and reduce the need for transfusions. We wanted to evaluate whether current evidence showed that removing the spleen was safe and effective in the long term and compare different surgical methods of removing the spleen. Search date The evidence is current to: 02 August 2019. Study characteristics One study with a total of 28 participant was included in the review. This study compared two methods of splenectomy ‚Äê laparoscopic (keyhole) versus an open surgical approach. Study participants were recruited over a period of 3.5 years, but participants were only followed up to the end of their hospital stay (usually less than one week). Key results The study evaluated the two types of surgical methods. Only one of our three primary outcomes were reported, the number of people experiencing major adverse events (bleeding during and after the operation and complete or partial collapse of a lung). However, the amount of information available is not sufficient to draw any reliable conclusions (very‚Äêlow quality evidence). Hence, we were unable to provide recommendations regarding the use of splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Appropriate clinical judgement, in view of the various risks and benefits described by other lower quality sources of evidence (e.g. observational studies), may be necessary when considering splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Quality of the evidence While we are satisfied that the participants had equal chances of undergoing either type of surgery, there is not enough information on other aspects of the study to make any overall judgement on its quality.",Splenectomy for people with thalassaemia major or intermedia,Sharma and  A; Easow Mathew and  M; Puri and  L,3,3,3,unclear since it is conservative treatment and no specific intervention but they do list some interventions,3
CD005502.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy remain refractory to drug treatment and continue to experience seizures whilst taking one or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Several non‚Äêpharmacological interventions that may be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to AEDs are available for refractory patients. In view of the fact that seizures in people with intellectual disabilities are often complex and refractory to pharmacological interventions, it is evident that good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to assess the efficacy of alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacological interventions. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review ( Beavis 2007 ) published in  The Cochrane Library  (2007, Issue 4). Objectives To assess data derived from randomised controlled trials of non‚Äêpharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Non‚Äêpharmacological interventions include, but are not limited to, the following. ‚Ä¢ Surgical procedures. ‚Ä¢ Specialised diets, for example, the ketogenic diet, or vitamin and folic acid supplementation. ‚Ä¢ Psychological interventions for patients or for patients and carers/parents, for example, cognitive‚Äêbehavioural therapy (CBT), electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback and educational intervention. ‚Ä¢ Yoga. ‚Ä¢ Acupuncture. ‚Ä¢ Relaxation therapy (e.g. music therapy). Search methods For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (19 August 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via CRSO (19 August 2014), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 19 August 2014) and PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1887 to 19 August 2014). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of non‚Äêpharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted study data. Main results One study is included in this review. When two surgical procedures were compared, results indicated that corpus callosotomy with anterior temporal lobectomy was more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. No evidence was found to support superior benefit in seizure control for either intervention. This is the only study of its kind and was rated as having an overall unclear risk of bias. The previous update (December 2010) identified one RCT in progress. The study authors have confirmed that they are aiming to publish by the end of 2015; therefore this study ( Bjurulf 2008 ) has not been included in the current review. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the need for well‚Äêdesigned randomised controlled trials conducted to assess the effects of non‚Äêpharmacological interventions on seizure and behavioural outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. Plain language summary Non‚Äêpharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterised by involuntary activity of the brain, which manifests in seizures. The rate of epilepsy in people with intellectual diabilities is significantly higher than in the general population. Epilepsy in this population is often less responsive to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. One relevant study comparing two surgical procedures has been included in this review. This study found that anterior corpus callosotomy (a procedure in which a section of the corpus callosum is severed) with anterior temporal lobectomy (a procedure in which part of the temporal lobe is removed) is more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. No support was found for a relative benefit of either procedure for improved seizure control. This review accentuates the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating non‚Äêpharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Given the prevalence and nature of epilepsy in this population, well‚Äêdesigned RCTs are needed to ascertain the effects of non‚Äêpharmacological interventions on seizure and behavioural outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities. However, good quality evidence derived from RCTs including the non‚Äêintellectually disabled should be assessed for side effects and efficacy before such studies are undertaken.",Non‚Äêpharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities,Jackson and  CF; Makin and  SM; Marson and  AG; Kerr and  M,3,2,2,purely non pharma,2
CD002270,"Abstract - Background Intraventricular hemorrhage remains a serious complication of premature birth and post‚Äêhemorrhagic hydrocephalus still has no satisfactory treatment. Acetazolamide and furosemide, which both reduce the production of cerebrospinal fluid, have been suggested as non‚Äêinvasive therapies to reduce hydrocephalus and the need for ventriculo‚Äêperitoneal (V‚ÄêP) shunting. Objectives To determine the effect of acetazolamide and furosemide on shunt dependence and other complications in infants developing post‚Äêhemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. Search methods Searches were performed of electronic databases (MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1974 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library). PubMed was searched on April 18, 2007 and Issue 2, 2007 of The Cochrane Library was searched. Selection criteria Randomised, or quasi‚Äêrandomised trials, of acetazolamide and/or furosemide compared with standard therapy in infants with IVH or post‚Äêhemorrhagic ventricular dilatation Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by each author and were analysed by the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD), a fixed effect model and sensitivity analyses where appropriate. Main results There were two eligible trials: one randomized 16 infants and the other 177 infants. Neither study showed a decreased risk for V‚ÄêP shunt or for V‚ÄêP shunt or death associated with acetazolamide and furosemide therapy. The larger trial showed that acetazolamide and furosemide treatment resulted in a borderline increase in the risk for motor impairment at one year (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 ‚Äê 1.58; RD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 ‚Äê 0.31), but did not significantly affect the risk for the combined outcome of delay, disability or motor impairment among survivors, or the risk of the combined outcome of death, delay, disability or impairment at one year. The larger trial showed that diuretic treatment increased the risk for nephrocalcinosis (RR 5.31, 95% CI 1.90 ‚Äê 14.84; RD 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 ‚Äê 0.29); meta‚Äêanalysis confirmed this result. Authors' conclusions Acetazolamide and furosemide therapy is neither effective nor safe in treating post‚Äêhemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. Acetazolamide and furosemide cannot be recommended as therapy for post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Plain language summary Diuretic therapy for newborn infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation Bleeding (hemorrhage) into the fluid‚Äêproducing cavities (ventricles) of the brain is a serious complication of premature birth. Large hemorrhages may result in fluid building up under pressure, progressively enlarging the brain and head. Current treatment approaches, including the insertion of a valve drainage system (shunt) are fraught with problems. Acetazolamide and furosemide, two drugs with diuretic action, reduce the production of fluid in the ventricles of the brain and have been proposed as safe treatments to treat dilatation of the ventricles after intraventricular hemorrhage in newborn infants. When compared with standard treatment, diuretic therapy was found not to reduce the need for shunt surgery.

CD012602.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks‚Äô gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. An estimated 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Miscarriage can lead to serious morbidity, including haemorrhage, infection, and even death, particularly in settings without adequate healthcare provision. Early miscarriages occur during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and can be managed expectantly, medically or surgically. However, there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and risks of each option. Objectives To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different management methods for early miscarriage, and to provide rankings of the available methods according to their effectiveness, safety, and side‚Äêeffect profile using a network meta‚Äêanalysis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth‚Äôs Trials Register (9 February 2021),  ClinicalTrials.gov  and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (12 February 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of methods for miscarriage management. Early miscarriage was defined as less than or equal to 14 weeks of gestation, and included missed and incomplete miscarriage. Management of late miscarriages after 14 weeks of gestation (often referred to as intrauterine fetal deaths) was not eligible for inclusion in the review. Cluster‚Äê and quasi‚Äêrandomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded non‚Äêrandomised trials. Data collection and analysis At least three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for the primary outcomes of complete miscarriage and composite outcome of death or serious complications. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Relative effects for the primary outcomes are reported subgrouped by the type of miscarriage (incomplete and missed miscarriage). We also performed pairwise meta‚Äêanalyses and network meta‚Äêanalysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available methods. Main results Our network meta‚Äêanalysis included 78 randomised trials involving 17,795 women from 37 countries. Most trials (71/78) were conducted in hospital settings and included women with missed or incomplete miscarriage. Across 158 trial arms, the following methods were used: 51 trial arms (33%) used misoprostol; 50 (32%) used suction aspiration; 26 (16%) used expectant management or placebo; 17 (11%) used dilatation and curettage; 11 (6%) used mifepristone plus misoprostol; and three (2%) used suction aspiration plus cervical preparation. Of these 78 studies, 71 (90%) contributed data in a usable form for meta‚Äêanalysis. Complete miscarriage Based on the relative effects from the network meta‚Äêanalysis of 59 trials (12,591 women), we found that five methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for achieving a complete miscarriage: ¬∑ suction aspiration after cervical preparation (risk ratio (RR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.20, low‚Äêcertainty evidence), ¬∑ dilatation and curettage (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75, low‚Äêcertainty evidence), ¬∑ suction aspiration (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.62, low‚Äêcertainty evidence), ¬∑ mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.66, moderate‚Äêcertainty evidence), ¬∑ misoprostol (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46, low‚Äêcertainty evidence). The highest ranked surgical method was suction aspiration after cervical preparation. The highest ranked non‚Äêsurgical treatment was mifepristone plus misoprostol. All surgical methods were ranked higher than medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Composite outcome of death and serious complications Based on the relative effects from the network meta‚Äêanalysis of 35 trials (8161 women), we found that four methods with available data were compatible with a wide range of treatment effects compared with expectant management or placebo: ¬∑ dilatation and curettage (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.06, low‚Äêcertainty evidence), ¬∑ suction aspiration (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.32, low‚Äêcertainty evidence), ¬∑ misoprostol (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.15, low‚Äêcertainty evidence), ¬∑ mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.84, low‚Äêcertainty evidence). Importantly, no deaths were reported in these studies, thus this composite outcome was entirely composed of serious complications, including blood transfusions, uterine perforations, hysterectomies, and intensive care unit admissions. Expectant management and placebo ranked the lowest when compared with alternative treatment interventions. Subgroup analyses by type of miscarriage (missed or incomplete) agreed with the overall analysis in that surgical methods were the most effective treatment, followed by medical methods and then expectant management or placebo, but there are possible subgroup differences in the effectiveness of the available methods.  Authors' conclusions Based on relative effects from the network meta‚Äêanalysis, all surgical and medical methods for managing a miscarriage may be more effective than expectant management or placebo. Surgical methods were ranked highest for managing a miscarriage, followed by medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Expectant management or placebo had the highest chance of serious complications, including the need for unplanned or emergency surgery. A subgroup analysis showed that surgical and medical methods may be more beneficial in women with missed miscarriage compared to women with incomplete miscarriage. Since type of miscarriage (missed and incomplete) appears to be a source of inconsistency and heterogeneity within these data, we acknowledge that the main network meta‚Äêanalysis may be unreliable. However, we plan to explore this further in future updates and consider the primary analysis as separate networks for missed and incomplete miscarriage.  Plain language summary Which management option is best when women experience an early miscarriage? What is the issue? Miscarriage is the most common cause of pregnancy loss and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% of pregnancies will end in miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Miscarriage can lead to serious complications, including haemorrhage and infection, and even death, particularly in low‚Äêincome countries. Miscarriage is generally defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks‚Äô gestation. Most miscarriages happen in the first 14 weeks, and are known as early miscarriages. Why is this important? Miscarriage can be managed expectantly (waiting for the pregnancy tissue to pass naturally), medically (tablets given to make the womb expel the pregnancy tissue) or surgically (removal of the pregnancy tissue during surgery). However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side effects of the available methods for managing a miscarriage. The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out which method is the most effective and safest with the least side effects. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence in February 2021 and identified 78 studies involving 17,795 women. Most women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with missed (also called silent miscarriage where no pregnancy tissue has been expelled and there is no bleeding or pain) or incomplete miscarriage (already started to bleed or have pain and perhaps expelled some pregnancy tissue). We found evidence for six different methods of managing a miscarriage; three surgical methods (suction aspiration plus cervical preparation, dilatation and curettage, or suction aspiration), two medical methods (mifepristone plus misoprostol or misoprostol alone), and expectant management or placebo. The analysis suggested that all three surgical methods and both medical methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for completing the process of miscarriage. Suction aspiration plus cervical preparation was the best method of miscarriage management followed by dilatation and curettage, and suction aspiration alone. The two medical methods of mifepristone combined with misoprostol, and misoprostol alone were ranked fourth and fifth best methods, respectively. From the available data, we cannot learn much for the outcome of death or serious complications. No deaths were reported in the studies that contributed towards this outcome. Amongst the serious complications, the majority were women who required blood transfusions, some had womb perforations related to surgery or required further life‚Äêsaving procedures. We could not know which method is best for this outcome due to limited data. However, expectant management or placebo was associated with more serious complications compared with the alternative treatment options. We also looked separately at women suffering from an incomplete miscarriage compared to those suffering from a missed miscarriage. For both groups of women, all three surgical methods and both medical methods were found to be more effective than expectant management or placebo for providing a definitive treatment for a miscarriage. These analyses for incomplete and missed miscarriages agreed with the overall analysis in that surgical methods were better for providing a definitive treatment for a miscarriage than medical methods, which in turn were better than expectant management or placebo.

Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage, although the effect is uncertain. This is an update of a review first published in 2009 and previously updated in 2010. Objectives To assess the effects of decompressive surgery on nerve damage in leprosy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (15 October 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 9 in  The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2012), AMED (January 1985 to October 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to October 2012) and LILACS (from January 1982 to October 2012). We checked reference lists of the studies identified, the Current Controlled Trials Register (www.controlled‚Äêtrials.com) (1 November 2012), conference proceedings and contacted trial authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‚ÄêRCTs of decompressive surgery for nerve damage in leprosy. Data collection and analysis The primary outcome was improvement in sensory and motor nerve function after one year. Secondary outcomes were improvement in nerve function after two years, change in nerve pain and tenderness, and adverse events. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials and non‚Äêrandomised studies. Main results We included two RCTs involving 88 participants. The trials were at high risk of bias. The trials examined the added benefit of surgery over prednisolone for treatment of nerve damage of less than six months duration. After two years' follow‚Äêup there was only very low quality evidence of no significant difference in nerve function improvement between participants treated with surgery plus prednisolone or with prednisolone alone. Adverse effects of decompressive surgery were not adequately described. Authors' conclusions Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage in leprosy but the available evidence from RCTs is of very low quality and does not show a significant added benefit of surgery over steroid treatment alone.

CD009590.PUB2,"Abstract - Background This overview reports on interventions for pain relief and for subfertility in pre‚Äêmenopausal women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis. Objectives The objective of this overview was to summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on treatment options for women with pain or subfertility associated with endometriosis. Methods Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting pain or fertility outcomes in women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis were eligible for inclusion in the overview. We also identified Cochrane reviews in preparation (protocols and titles) for future inclusion. The reviews, protocols and titles were identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in March 2014. Pain‚Äêrelated outcomes of the overview were pain relief, clinical improvement or resolution and pain recurrence. Fertility‚Äêrelated outcomes were live birth, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage and adverse events. Selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE methods. Review findings were summarised in the text and the data for each outcome were reported in 'Additional tables'. Main results Seventeen systematic reviews published in  The Cochrane Library  were included. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. Limitations in the evidence included risk of bias in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies, and imprecision in effect estimates. Pain relief (14 reviews) Gonadotrophin‚Äêreleasing hormone (GnRH) analogues One systematic review reported low quality evidence of an overall benefit for GnRH analogues compared with placebo or no treatment. Ovulation suppression Five systematic reviews reported on medical treatment using ovulation suppression. There was moderate quality evidence that the levonorgestrel‚Äêreleasing intrauterine system (LNG‚ÄêIUD) was more effective than expectant management, and very low quality evidence that danazol was more effective than placebo. There was no consistent evidence of a difference in effectiveness between oral contraceptives and goserelin, estrogen plus progestogen and placebo, or progestogens and placebo, though in all cases the relevant evidence was of low or very low quality. Non‚Äêsteroidal anti‚Äêinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) A review of NSAIDs reported inconclusive evidence of a benefit in symptom relief compared with placebo. Surgical interventions There were two reviews of surgical interventions. One reported moderate quality evidence of a benefit in pain relief following laparoscopic surgery compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only. The other reported very low quality evidence that recurrence rates of endometriomata were lower after excisional surgery than after ablative surgery. Post‚Äêsurgical medical interventions Two reviews reported on post‚Äêsurgical medical interventions. Neither found evidence of an effect on pain outcomes, though in both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine There were two systematic reviews of alternative medicine. One reported evidence of a benefit from auricular acupuncture compared to Chinese herbal medicine, and the other reported no evidence of a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and danazol. In both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ± drugs One review found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between anti‚ÄêTNF‚ÄêŒ± drugs and placebo. However, the evidence was of low quality. Reviews reporting fertility outcomes (8 reviews) Medical interventions Four reviews reported on medical interventions for improving fertility in women with endometriosis. One compared three months of GnRH agonists with a control in women undergoing assisted reproduction and found very low quality evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancies in the treatment group. There was no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between the interventions in the other three reviews, which compared GnRH agonists versus antagonists, ovulation suppression versus placebo or no treatment, and pre‚Äêsurgical medical therapy versus surgery alone. In all cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Surgical interventions Three reviews reported on surgical interventions. There was moderate quality evidence that both live births or ongoing pregnancy rates and clinical pregnancy rates were higher after laparoscopic surgery than after diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was low quality evidence of no difference in effectiveness between surgery and expectant management for endometrioma. One review found low quality evidence that excisional surgery resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates than drainage or ablation of endometriomata. Post‚Äêsurgical interventions Two reviews reported on post‚Äêsurgical medical interventions. They found no evidence of an effect on clinical pregnancy rates. The evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine A  review of Chinese herbal medicine in comparison with gestrinone found no evidence of a difference between the groups in clinical pregnancy rates. However, the evidence was of low quality. Adverse events Reviews of GnRH analogues and of danazol reported that the interventions were associated with higher rates of adverse effects than placebo; and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates of adverse events than other treatments. Chinese herbal medicine was associated with fewer side effects than gestrinone or danazol. Three reviews reported miscarriage as an outcome. No difference was found between surgical and diagnostic laparoscopy, between GnRH agonists and antagonists, or between aspiration of endometrioma and expectant management. However, in all cases the quality of the evidence was of low quality. Authors' conclusions For women with pain and endometriosis, suppression of menstrual cycles with gonadotrophin‚Äêreleasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, the levonorgestrel‚Äêreleasing intrauterine system (LNG‚ÄêIUD) and danazol were beneficial interventions. Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis and excision of endometriomata were also associated with improvements in pain. The evidence on NSAIDs was inconclusive. There was no evidence of benefit with post‚Äêsurgical medical treatment. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence on harms was scanty, but GnRH analogues, danazol and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates than other interventions. Plain language summary Endometriosis: an overview of Cochrane Reviews Background Cochrane review authors examined the evidence on endometriosis from Cochrane systematic reviews published in  The Cochrane Library . We aimed to summarise the evidence on treatment options that are available to women with pain or subfertility, or both, associated with clinically diagnosed endometriosis. Study characteristics We included 17 Cochrane systematic reviews. Fourteen reported measures of pain relief and eight reported fertility outcomes. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons and outcomes ranged from very low to moderate, due to limitations in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies and imprecision in the findings. Key results A number of interventions appeared effective in alleviating pain in women with endometriosis. These were gonadotrophin‚Äêreleasing hormone (GnRH) analogues when compared with placebo, the levonorgestrel‚Äêreleasing intrauterine system (LNG‚ÄêIUD) compared with expectant management, danazol compared with placebo, and progestagens and anti‚Äêprogestagens compared with placebo. Laparoscopic surgical interventions also appeared to be effective for pain. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates.

Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and non‚Äêrandom studies of EC/IC bypass surgery plus best medical treatment compared with best medical treatment alone to prevent subsequent stroke, improve cerebral haemodynamics and reduce dependency after stroke. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, and extracted data items on the number of outcome events onto a data extraction form. We only analysed secondary outcomes if the study provided information on at least one primary outcome. We also used intention‚Äêto‚Äêtreat analysis where possible. Main results We included 21 trials, including two RCTs, involving 2591 patients. For all endpoints, no benefit of EC/IC bypass surgery was shown either in the RCTs (any death: odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05, P = 0.11; stroke: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23, P = 0.91; death and dependency: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21, P = 0.64), or in the non‚ÄêRCTs (any death: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.62, P = 0.99; stroke: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.18, P = 0.25; death and dependency: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29, P = 0.37). Authors' conclusions EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with sCAO disease was neither superior nor inferior to medical care alone. However, most studies included patients irrespective of their cerebral haemodynamics. Participation in an ongoing RCT, which is restricted to patients with impaired haemodynamics, is recommended as these patients might benefit from bypass surgery. Plain language summary Extracranial‚Äêintracranial arterial bypass surgery for occlusive carotid artery disease Patients with symptomatic occlusion (obstruction) of the carotid artery have a high risk of subsequent stroke. Anticoagulant treatment and antiplatelet agents are not very effective in these patients and a surgical procedure known as extracranial‚Äêintracranial (EC/IC) arterial bypass surgery has been a treatment option. In this review, we included 21 trials (two randomised controlled trials and 19 non‚Äêrandom studies, with a total of 2591 patients). We found that EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease was no better or worse than medical care alone. A multi‚Äêcentre trial comparing EC/IC bypass surgery with best medical treatment in patients with both a high risk of stroke and haemodynamic compromise (impaired blood flow) is underway, and aims to discover whether EC/IC bypass surgery is beneficial in this specific group of patients.",Extracranial‚Äêintracranial arterial bypass surgery for occlusive carotid artery disease,Fluri and  F; Engelter and  S; Lyrer and  P,3,2,3,best medical management,3
CD005320.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Dislocation following hip replacement is associated with significant morbidity and functional cost. The cause is usually multifactorial. A variety of treatment options are available which can broadly be classified into operative and non‚Äêoperative. Objectives To determine the best methods of treatment of recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement. Search methods The following databases were searched until August 2006: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Health Technology Assessment database (HTA), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), and MetaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‚Äêrandomised trials comparing operative and non‚Äêoperative treatments for recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement. Data collection and analysis Two independent reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to identified studies. Main results Searches identified 269 studies. None fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions The authors invite researchers to perform RCTs comparing different treatment options for recurrent dislocation of the hip. The heterogeneity of the population and variety of underlying causes would favour a multi‚Äêcentre study to achieve an adequate sample size. Plain language summary Treatments for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of treatments for dislocation of the hip after total hip replacement surgery. The review shows that: It is not known what the best treatment for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery is. This is because no evidence was found that looked at the treatments for dislocation of the hip after surgery. What are the treatments for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery?   In total hip replacement surgery, the whole hip joint can be replaced by an artificial joint or hip. About 3 out of 100 people who have this surgery will dislocate their hip. Dislocating a hip causes much pain and other problems. There are many ways to fix a dislocated hip. Usually, the first time a dislocation occurs the hip is put into a cast or brace. But repeated dislocations usually need to be fixed with surgery. Unfortunately, the causes for dislocation are many and some are not known making it difficult to know the best way to fix it. What are the results of this review?   No evidence was found that looked at the treatments for dislocation of the hip after surgery.",Operative and non‚Äêoperative treatment options for dislocation of the hip following total hip arthroplasty,Khan and  RJK; Carey Smith and  RL; Alakeson and  R; Fick and  DP; Wood and  DJ,3,3,3,operative v non operative but not clear that there's much pharmacological to do in hip arthroplasty,3
CD010349.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Patients with newly diagnosed high‚Äêrisk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL) still have a poor outcome, despite multi‚Äêmodality intensive therapy. This poor outcome necessitates the search for new therapies, such as treatment with  131 I‚Äêmeta‚Äêiodobenzylguanidine ( 131 I‚ÄêMIBG). Objectives To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of  131 I‚ÄêMIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1945 to 25 April 2016) and Embase (Ovid) (1980 to 25 April 2016). In addition, we handsearched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We also assessed the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology, Advances in Neuroblastoma Research and the American Society of Clinical Oncology; all from 2010 up to and including 2015. We scanned the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Register (www.isrctn.com) and the National Institutes of Health Register for ongoing trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) on 13 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), non‚Äêrandomised single‚Äêarm trials with historical controls and cohort studies examining the efficacy of  131 I‚ÄêMIBG therapy in 10 or more patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results We identified two eligible cohort studies including 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. All studies had methodological limitations, with regard to both internal (risk of bias) and external validity. As the studies were not comparable with regard to prognostic factors and treatment (and often used different outcome definitions), pooling of results was not possible. In one study, the objective response rate (ORR) was 73% after surgery; the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 7 to 23); five‚Äêyear overall survival was 14.6%; median event‚Äêfree survival was 10 months (95% CI 7 to 13); and five‚Äêyear event‚Äêfree survival was 12.2%. In the other study, the ORR was 56% after myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation; 10‚Äêyear overall survival was 6.25%; and event‚Äêfree survival was not reported. With regard to short‚Äêterm adverse effects, one study showed a prevalence of 2% (95% CI 0% to 13%; best‚Äêcase scenario) for death due to myelosuppression. After the first cycle of  131 I‚ÄêMIBG therapy in one study, platelet toxicity occurred in 38% (95% CI 18% to 61%), neutrophil toxicity in 50% (95% CI 28% to 72%) and haemoglobin toxicity in 69% (95% CI 44% to 86%); after the second cycle this was 60% (95% CI 36% to 80%) for platelets and neutrophils and 53% (95% CI 30% to 75%) for haemoglobin. In one study, the prevalence of hepatic toxicity during or within four weeks after last the MIBG treatment was 0% (95% CI 0% to 9%; best‚Äêcase scenario). Neither study reported cardiovascular toxicity and sialoadenitis. One study assessed long‚Äêterm adverse events in some of the children: there was elevated plasma thyroid‚Äêstimulating hormone in 45% (95% CI 27% to 65%) of children; in all children, free T4 was within the age‚Äêrelated normal range (0%, 95% CI 0% to 15%). There were no secondary malignancies observed (0%, 95% CI 0% to 9%), but only five children survived more than four years. Authors' conclusions We identified no RCTs or CCTs comparing the effectiveness of treatment including  131 I‚ÄêMIBG therapy versus treatment not including  131 I‚ÄêMIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. We found two small observational studies including chilren. They had high risk of bias, and not all relevant outcome results were available. Based on the currently available evidence, we cannot make recommendations for the use of  131 I‚ÄêMIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL in clinical practice. More high‚Äêquality research is needed. Plain language summary Iodine‚Äê131‚Äêmeta‚Äêiodobenzylguanidine therapy for patients with newly diagnosed high‚Äêrisk neuroblastoma Review question We reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness and side effects of  131 I‚Äêmeta‚Äêiodobenzylguanidine ( 131 I‚ÄêMIBG) therapy in patients with newly diagnosed high‚Äêrisk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL). Background NBL is a rare solid cancer that develops from special nerves cells. Patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL have a poor outcome, despite intensive treatments such as high‚Äêdose chemotherapy to kill the cancer and surgery. This poor outcome needs research to look for new therapies, such as treatment with  131 I‚ÄêMIBG, which is a type of targeted radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer without causing too much damage to surrounding area). Study characteristics The evidence is current to April 2016. We found two cohort studies (where a group of people (the cohort) is followed over time, to examine different treatments received and subsequent outcomes) looking at  131 I‚ÄêMIBG treatment in 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Key results The studies were not comparable with regard to the children, the ways they were treated and the ways the different outcomes were defined and so it was impossible to combine the results in an analysis. Not all relevant outcome results were available. The percentages of children whose cancer reduced or disappeared after treatment (response rate) were 56% and 73% in the two studies, but survival was still poor: overall survival (length of time that the child remained alive) was about 15 months, event‚Äêfree survival (time during which there were no objective signs of tumor recurrence) was about 10 months. Overall survival five years after treatment was 14.6%, and after 10 years was 12.2%. With regard to short‚Äêterm side effects, there were some low blood cell counts. There was no liver toxicity. The studies did not report on heart problems and infections of the salivary glands. One study assessed long‚Äêterm side effects in some of the children: there was some evidence of thyroid (a gland in the neck) problems, which was brief in three children, but remained high in seven children, of whom five were prescribed medicine. There were no secondary cancers (where a different type of cancer has returned following the original cancer). Based on the currently available evidence, we cannot make recommendations for the use of  131 I‚ÄêMIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL in clinical practice. More high‚Äêquality research is needed before definite conclusions can be made.

CD008797.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Chronic pelvic pain is a common and debilitating condition; its aetiology is multifactorial, involving social, psychological and biological factors. The management of chronic pelvic pain is challenging, as despite interventions involving surgery, many women remain in pain without a firm gynaecological diagnosis. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of non‚Äêsurgical interventions for women with chronic pelvic pain. Search methods We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register. We also searched (from inception to 5 February 2014) AMED, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We handsearched sources such as citation lists, trial registers and conference proceedings. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on non‚Äêsurgical management of chronic pelvic pain were eligible for inclusion. We included studies of women with a diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome or adhesions but excluded those with pain known to be caused by endometriosis, primary dysmenorrhoea (period pain), active chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or irritable bowel syndrome. We considered studies of any non‚Äêsurgical intervention, including lifestyle, physical, medical and psychological treatments. Data collection and analysis Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Meta‚Äêanalysis was performed using the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome measure was pain relief, and secondary outcome measures were psychological outcomes, quality of life, requirement for analgesia and adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was assessed by using GRADE methods. Main results Twenty‚Äêone RCTs were identified that involved non‚Äêsurgical management of chronic pelvic pain: 13 trials were included in the review, and eight were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women‚Äî406 women in the intervention groups and 344 in the control groups. Included studies had high attrition rates, and investigators often did not blind adequately or did not clearly describe randomisation procedures. Medical treatment versus placebo Progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)) was more effective than placebo at the end of treatment in terms of the number of women achieving a greater than 50% reduction in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score immediately after treatment (Peto OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.70 to 5.31, two studies, n = 204, I 2  = 22%, moderate‚Äêquality evidence). Evidence of benefit was maintained up to nine months after treatment (Peto OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.71, two studies, n = 204, I 2  = 0%, moderate‚Äêquality evidence). Women treated with progestogen reported more adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness) than those given placebo (high‚Äêquality evidence). The estimated effect of lofexidine on pain outcomes when compared with placebo was compatible with benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.61, one study, 39 women, low‚Äêquality evidence). Women in the lofexidine group reported more adverse effects (including drowsiness and dry mouth) than women given placebo (moderate‚Äêquality evidence). Head‚Äêto‚Äêhead comparisons of medical treatments Head‚Äêto‚Äêhead comparisons showed that women taking goserelin had greater improvement in pelvic pain score (MD 3, 95% CI 2.08 to 3.92, one study, n = 47, moderate‚Äêquality evidence) at one year than those taking progestogen. Women taking gabapentin had a lower VAS pain score than those taking amytriptyline (MD ‚Äê1.50, 95% CI ‚Äê2.06 to ‚Äê0.94, n = 40, low‚Äêquality evidence). Study authors reported that no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of adverse effects among women taking gabapentin compared with women given amytriptyline. The study comparing goserelin versus progestogen did not report on adverse effects. Psychological treatment Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those treated with a standard 'wait and see' policy (Peto OR 6.77, 95% CI 2.83 to 16.19, n = 90, low‚Äêquality evidence). Significantly more women who had writing therapy as a disclosure reported improvement in pain than those in the non‚Äêdisclosure group (Peto OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.41 to 14.13, n = 48, very low‚Äêquality evidence). No difference between groups in pain outcomes was noted when other psychological therapies were compared with standard care or placebo (quality of evidence ranged from very low to low). Studies did not report on adverse effects. Complementary therapy Distension of painful pelvic structures was more effective for pain when compared with counselling (MD 35.8, 95% CI 23.08 to 48.52 on a zero to 100 scale, one study, n = 48, moderate‚Äêquality evidence). No difference in pain levels was observed when magnetic therapy was compared with use of a control magnet (very low‚Äêquality evidence). Studies did not report on adverse effects. The results of studies examining psychological and complementary therapies could not be combined to yield meaningful results. Authors' conclusions Evidence of moderate quality supports progestogen as an option for chronic pelvic pain, with efficacy reported during treatment. In practice, this option may be most acceptable among women unconcerned about progestogenic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness‚Äîthe most common adverse effects). Although some evidence suggests possible benefit of goserelin when compared with progestogen, gabapentin as compared with amytriptyline, ultrasound versus 'wait and see' and writing therapy versus non‚Äêdisclosure, the quality of evidence is generally low, and evidence is drawn from single studies. Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, RCTs of other medical, lifestyle and psychological interventions are urgently required. Plain language summary Non‚Äêsurgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain Review question Cochrane authors considered the evidence for effectiveness and safety of non‚Äêsurgical treatrments for managing chronic pelvic pain in women. Background Chronic pelvic pain in women is a common problem. Specific causes are often difficult to identify, even after investigation with ultrasound and inspection of the pelvis with key hole surgery. Treatment is frequently limited to relief of symptoms obtained with a concoction of medicines. Cochrane review authors examined the evidence about non‚Äêsurgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain. Study characteristics Twenty‚Äêone randomised controlled studies were identified, of which 13 were included. Eight studies were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women‚Äî406 women in the intervention groups and 344 women in the control groups. The interventions assessed included medical treatment and psychological, cognitive, behavioural, complementary and physical therapies. The evidence is current to February 2014. Key results The review concludes that evidence shows improvement of pain in women given a high dose of progestogen (50 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) immediately post‚Äêtreatment and for up to nine months after treatment. However, progestogen was associated with adverse effects such as weight gain and bloating. Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and who received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those whose treatment involved a 'wait and see' policy. Some evidence of benefit was seen with writing disclosure therapy and with distension of painful pelvic structures. No good evidence of benefit was noted with other interventions when compared with standard care or placebo. The quality of the evidence was low or moderate for most comparisons, and in most cases evidence was derived from single small studies. Moreover, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions on quality of life and physical and functional outcomes because of the large variation in outcome measures used by the included studies. Many interventions identified in this review involved only single studies with small sample sizes. Additional studies will be required in the future to replicate results obtained with the use of specific medical interventions.",Non‚Äêsurgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain,Cheong and  YC; Smotra and  G; Williams and  ACDC,3,2,2,no surgical treatment mentioned,2
CD010712,"Abstract - Background Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated pathological spinal conditions. It frequently afflicts the elderly population. Objectives To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) databases were searched up to June 2012. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials published in English, in which at least one arm provided data on nonoperative treatments Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by two review authors using the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group ( Furlan 2009 ). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as relative risk, continuous outcomes as mean difference or standardized mean difference; uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals. If possible a meta‚Äêanalysis was performed, otherwise results were described qualitatively. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results From the 8635 citations screened, 56 full‚Äêtext articles were assessed and 21 trials (1851 participants) were included. There was very low‚Äêquality evidence from six trials that calcitonin is no better than placebo or paracetamol, regardless of mode of administration or outcome assessed. From single small trials, there was low‚Äêquality evidence for prostaglandins, and very low‚Äêquality evidence for gabapentin or methylcobalamin that they improved walking distance. There was very low‚Äêquality evidence from a single trial that epidural steroid injections improved pain, function, and quality of life, up to two weeks, compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy. There was low‚Äêquality evidence from a single trial that exercise is of short‚Äêterm benefit for leg pain and function compared with no treatment. There was low and very low‚Äêquality evidence from six trials that multimodal nonoperative treatment is less effective than indirect or direct surgical decompression with or without fusion. A meta‚Äêanalysis of two trials comparing direct decompression with or without fusion to multimodal nonoperative care found no significant difference in function at six months (mean difference (MD) ‚Äê3.66, 95% CI ‚Äê10.12 to 2.80) and one year (MD ‚Äê6.18, 95% CI ‚Äê15.03 to 2.66), but at 24 months a significant difference was found favouring decompression (MD ‚Äê4.43, 95% CI ‚Äê7.91 to ‚Äê0.96). Authors' conclusions Moderate and high‚Äêquality evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibits recommendations for guiding clinical practice. Given the expected exponential rise in the prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, large high‚Äêquality trials are urgently needed. Plain language summary Non‚Äêsurgical treatment for spinal stenosis with leg pain Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of non‚Äêsurgical treatments for people with leg pain caused by pressure on the nerves in the spine. Background If the spinal canal becomes narrow and presses on nerves (spinal stenosis) it can cause pain in the legs or buttocks (neurogenic claudication). Spinal stenosis is treated with a variety of non‚Äêsurgical methods, including painkillers and other medications, injections into the spine, exercise, physiotherapy and similar treatments. We wanted to discover whether using non‚Äêsurgical methods was better or worse than other alternatives. Study characteristics We included 21 randomised controlled trials that compared non‚Äêsurgical treatments to placebo, no treatment, or to surgery. All the participants had leg pain and a confirmed diagnosis of lumbar stenosis. There were 1851 people, with an average age of 50 years, equally divided between men and women. The follow‚Äêup time ranged from one week to six years. The evidence was current to June 2012. Key results Overall, the review suggests that surgery is more effective at relieving pain than non‚Äêsurgical treatments. Medicines taken by mouth.  One small trial each of prostaglandins (compared to another medicine), gabapentin (compared to placebo), and vitamin B1 (compared to a variety of treatments) suggested improvements in pain and walking distance. Some digestive problems were reported with both medicines in the prostaglandins trial; and some people in the gabapentin trial reported dizziness or sleepiness. Epidural injections.  Two small trials showed short‚Äêterm improvements in pain and quality of life (up to two weeks) and two showed no difference compared with placebo injections. No trial reported bad reactions or problems. Calcitonin injections.  Six small trials indicated that calcitonin is no better than paracetemol or placebo. A number of people reported feeling sick or developed a rash. Mixed approaches compared to surgery.  Five trials compared results from surgery with results from a variety of non‚Äêsurgical treatments. One trial found that after two years there was no difference between treatments as far as pain was concerned. The other four found that surgery improved pain more than non‚Äêsurgical treatments over different time periods, but not necessarily walking ability. Between 5% and 18% suffered unwanted side effects from surgery, some serious. Physical therapy.  Four small trials, all including some form of exercise, failed to demonstrate improved walking ability after physical therapy. One trial each suggested that exercise is better than no treatment for leg pain, and that treadmill walking and stationary cycling produce similar, limited results. Quality of evidence The findings of all the trials in this study were based on low or very low‚Äêquality evidence. The studies were poorly designed, or they failed to give enough information about what was done. This means that we cannot be confident that the findings are reliable, and further research may well come to a different conclusion.",Nonoperative treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication,Ammendolia and  C; Stuber and  KJ; Rok and  E; Rampersaud and  R; Kennedy and  CA; Pennick and  V; Steenstra and  IA; de Bruin and  LK; Furlan and  AD,3,2,1,include since it says one arm being medical and that means that the other must be surgical even though it is not entirely explicit,1
CD012551.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder in which the two main clinical features are pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non‚Äêpharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health ‚Äê Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH‚ÄêCPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. Objectives To assess the effects of non‚Äêpharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Search methods We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non‚Äêpharmacological interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. Main results We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons. 1. Acupuncture:  (three studies, 204 participants) based on short‚Äêterm follow‚Äêup, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH‚ÄêCPSI score ‚Äê5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‚Äê7.32 to ‚Äê4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale ‚Äê0.50, 95% CI ‚Äê3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD ‚Äê6.05, 95% CI ‚Äê7.87 to ‚Äê4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 2. Lifestyle modifications:  (one study, 100 participants) based on short‚Äêterm follow‚Äêup, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH‚ÄêCPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 3. Physical activity:  (one study, 85 participants) based on short‚Äêterm follow‚Äêup, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‚ÄêCPSI score MD ‚Äê2.50, 95% CI ‚Äê4.69 to ‚Äê0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life. 4. Prostatic massage:  (two studies, 115 participants) based on short‚Äêterm follow‚Äêup, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy:  (three studies, 157 participants) based on short‚Äêterm follow‚Äêup, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‚ÄêCPSI score MD ‚Äê6.18, 95% CI ‚Äê7.46 to ‚Äê4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium‚Äêterm follow‚Äêup (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy:  (two studies, 237 participants) based on short‚Äêterm follow‚Äêup, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH‚ÄêCPSI score MD ‚Äê2.50, 95% CI ‚Äê3.82 to ‚Äê1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 7. Other interventions:  there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. Authors' conclusions Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non‚Äêpharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient‚Äêimportant outcomes including potential treatment‚Äêrelated adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.

Its cause is unknown and there are many different treatments for this condition. Study characteristics The evidence was current to August 2017. We found 38 studies that were conducted between 1993 and 2016 with 3187 participants that made 23 comparisons between different treatments in men with CP/CPPS. The evaluated interventions usually implied the use of devices, medical advice or some form of physical therapy. In many cases, these therapies were given to men in an outpatient setting. Most studies did not specify their funding sources; three studies reported funding from device makers. Key results Acupuncture:  we found that acupuncture (an alternative medicine where thin needles are inserted into the skin at specific points) probably causes a significant decrease in symptoms of prostatitis and may not associated with side effects when compared with pretend acupuncture, however, it may not reduce sexual problems. It probably decreases symptoms when compared with standard medical therapy. We found no information on its effect on quality of life, depression or anxiety. Lifestyle modifications:  we are uncertain whether the recommendation of lifestyle modifications reduces symptoms when compared to the continuation of the same lifestyle. We had no information regarding side effects, sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. Physical activity:  we found that a physical activity programme may reduce symptoms (small effect) when compared with a non‚Äêspecific activity used as a control, however it may not reduce anxiety or depression. We have no information regarding side effects, sexual problems or quality of life. Prostatic massage:  we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases symptoms when compared with no massage. We found no information regarding side effects, sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy:  we found that extracorporeal shockwave therapy (where shock waves are passed through the skin to the prostate) causes a significant decrease in symptoms compared to a simulated procedure. These results may not be lasting after more continued treatment. This treatment may not be associated with side effects. We have no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy:  we found that transrectal thermotherapy (which applies heat to the prostate and pelvic muscle area) alone or in combination with medical therapy may cause a small decrease in symptoms compared to medical therapy alone. One of the included studies reported that participants may experience transient side effects. We have no information regarding sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. There is uncertainty about the effects of other interventions. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low in most cases, meaning that there is much uncertainty surrounding the results. The included studies were not well designed, had a small sample size and had a short follow‚Äêup time (usually 12 weeks).",Non‚Äêpharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome,Franco and  JVA; Turk and  T; Jung and  JH; Xiao and  YT; Iakhno and  S; Garrote and  V; Vietto and  V,3,2,2,,2
CD009346.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Rocuronium bromide is a routinely used muscle relaxant in anaesthetic practice. Its use, however, is associated with intense pain on injection. While it is well established that rocuronium bromide injection causes pain in awake patients, anaesthetized patients also tend to show withdrawal movements of the limbs when this muscle relaxant is administered. Various strategies, both pharmacological and non‚Äêpharmacological, have been studied to reduce the incidence and severity of pain on rocuronium bromide injection. We wanted to find out which of the existing modalities was best to reduce pain on rocuronium injection. Objectives The objectives of this review were to assess the ability of both pharmacological and non‚Äêpharmacological interventions to reduce or eliminate the pain that accompanies rocuronium bromide administration. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1966 to July 2013) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1980 to July 2013). We also searched specific websites. We reran the searches in February 2015 and will deal with the 11 studies of interest found through this search when we update the review. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any drug or a non‚Äêpharmacological method with control patients, or those receiving no treatment to reduce the severity of pain with rocuronium injection. Our primary outcome was pain on rocuronium bromide injection measured by a pain score assessment. Our secondary outcomes were rise in heart rate and blood pressure following administration of rocuronium and adverse events related to the interventions. Data collection and analysis We used the standardized methods for conducting a systematic review as described in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Two authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We made all analyses on an intention‚Äêto‚Äêtreat basis. We used a fixed‚Äêeffect model where there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies and a random‚Äêeffects model if heterogeneity was likely. Main results We included 66 studies with 7840 participants in the review, though most analyses were based on data from fewer participants. In total there are 17 studies awaiting classification. No studies were at a low risk of bias. We noted substantial statistical and clinical heterogeneity between trials. Most of the studies reported the primary outcome pain as assessed by verbal response from participants in an awake state but some trials reported withdrawal of the injected limb as a proxy for pain after induction of anaesthesia in response to rocuronium administration. Few studies reported adverse events and no study reported heart rate and blood pressure changes after administration of rocuronium. Lidocaine was the most commonly studied intervention drug, used in 29 trials with 2256 participants. The risk ratio (RR) of pain on injection if given lidocaine compared to placebo was 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.31; I¬≤ = 65%, low quality of evidence). The RR of pain on injection if fentanyl and remifentanil were given compared to placebo was 0.42 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.70; I¬≤ = 79%, low quality of evidence) and (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.26; I¬≤ = 74%, low quality of evidence), respectively. Pain on injection of intervention drugs was reported with the use of lidocaine and acetaminophen in one study. Cough was reported with the use of fentanyl (one study), remifentanil (five studies, low quality evidence) and alfentanil (one study). Breath holding and chest tightness were reported with the use of remifentanil in two studies (very low quality evidence) and one study (very low quality evidence), respectively. The overall rate of complications was low. Authors' conclusions The evidence to suggest that the most commonly investigated pharmacological interventions reduce pain on injection of rocuronium is of low quality due to risk of bias and inconsistency. There is low or very low quality evidence for adverse events, due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision of effect. We did not compare the various interventions with one another and so cannot comment on the superiority of one intervention over another. Complications were reported more often with use of opioids. Plain language summary Use of drug and non‚Äêdrug interventions to reduce pain associated with rocuronium bromide injection in patients undergoing general anaesthesia Review question What is the effect of using drug or non‚Äêdrug treatments (such as diluting the rocuronium or warming the site of injection) for reducing the pain associated with injecting the muscle relaxant rocuronium bromide in children and adults? Background Rocuronium bromide is a muscle relaxant used as part of general anaesthesia for surgery. Muscle relaxants are used to relax the muscles of the airway to enable endotracheal intubation (placing a breathing tube in the windpipe to support the airway while the person is unconscious) and to facilitate the surgery. However, rocuronium bromide can cause intense pain as it is injected in some people. We wanted to find out whether giving another drug, such as a painkiller or another anaesthetic, or a non‚Äêdrug intervention, such as diluting the rocuronium, would be useful in reducing the pain experienced by some people on injection of rocuronium. Study characteristics We included trials up to July 2013 in our review. We re‚Äêran the searches in February 2015. In total there are 17 studies awaiting classification. We included 66 studies with 7840 participants, both male and female, and including children and adults. Most of these participants were undergoing various planned surgical procedures in hospitals in several countries including Korea, Turkey and India. The trials compared an intervention aiming to reduce pain on injection with a placebo to ascertain whether any intervention was effective at reducing pain. The outcome was assessed by recording the level of pain reported by patients when injected with rocuronium bromide. Key results The most studied treatments were injection of the local anaesthetic lidocaine, or the painkillers fentanyl or remifentanil, into the vein before injecting rocuronium. These treatments may reduce the pain associated with injecting rocuronium, but the evidence is of low quality. Some interventions, for example using painkillers such as fentanyl, may increase cough, chest tightness and breath holding. These are recognized side effects of these drugs. Quality of the evidence The low quality of the evidence for the assessment of changes in the level of pain was due to inadequate reporting of study design and variation in the study results. In addition to these limitations, for some adverse event outcomes we did not have enough information to be certain about the average effect. Further research is needed with high quality, well designed studies to determine whether pain on injection of rocuronium bromide can be reduced by using an appropriate intervention.",Pharmacological and non‚Äêpharmacological interventions for reducing rocuronium bromide induced pain on injection in children and adults,Prabhakar and  H; Singh and  GP; Ali and  Z; Kalaivani and  M; Smith and  MA,3,2,2,I cannot imagine a surgical intervention,2
CD004980,"Abstract - Background Varicose veins are a relatively common condition and account for around 54,000 in‚Äêpatient hospital episodes per year. The two most common interventions for varicose veins are surgery and sclerotherapy. However, there is little comparative data regarding their effectiveness. Objectives To identify whether the use of surgery or sclerotherapy should be recommended for the management of primary varicose veins. Search methods Thirteen electronic bibliographic databases were searched covering biomedical, science, social science, health economic and grey literature (including current research). In addition, the reference lists of relevant articles were checked and various health services research‚Äêrelated resources were consulted via the internet. These included health economics and HTA organisations, guideline producing agencies, generic research and trials registers, and specialist sites. Selection criteria All studies that were described as randomised controlled trials comparing surgery with sclerotherapy for the treatment of primary varicose veins were identified. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted and summarised data from the eligible studies using a data extraction sheet for consistency. All studies were cross‚Äêchecked independently by the authors. Main results A total of 2306 references were found from our searches, 61 of which were identified as potential trials comparing surgery and sclerotherapy. However, only nine randomised trials, described in a total of 14 separate papers, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Fifty trials were excluded and one trial is ongoing and is due for completion in 2004. The trials used a variety of outcome measures and classification systems which made direct comparison between trials difficult. However, the trend was for sclerotherapy to be evaluated as significantly better than surgery at one year; after one year (sclerotherapy resulted in worse outcomes) the benefits with sclerotherapy were less, and by three to five years surgery had better outcomes. The data on cost‚Äêeffectiveness was not adequately reported. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend the use of sclerotherapy or surgery. There needs to be more research that specifically examines both costs and outcomes for surgery and sclerotherapy. Plain language summary Surgery versus sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins Sclerotherapy (injection of a substance into the vein) shows greater benefits than surgery in the short term but surgery has greater benefits in the longer term. Varicose veins are a relatively common problem. Two treatments available are surgery and sclerotherapy. Both involve removal of the vein either by stripping it out (surgery) or by injecting it with a solution that causes it to collapse and be absorbed into the surrounding tissues (sclerotherapy). Neither treatment adversely affects blood flow through the limb. This review found that sclerotherapy was better than surgery in terms of treatment success, complication rate and cost at one year, but surgery was better after five years. However, the evidence was not of very good quality and more research is needed.",Surgery versus sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins,Rigby and  KA; Palfreyman and  SJ; Beverley and  C; Michaels and  JA,3,2,2,no medical aspect,2
CD011478.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with 528,000 estimated new cases globally in 2012. A large majority (around 85%) of the disease burden occurs in low‚Äê and middle‚Äêincome countries (LMICs), where it accounts for almost 12% of all female cancers. Treatment of stage IB2 cervical cancers, which sit between early and advanced disease, is controversial. Some centres prefer to treat these cancers by radical hysterectomy, with chemoradiotherapy reserved for those at high risk of recurrence. In the UK, we treat stage IB2 cervical cancers mainly with chemoradiotherapy, based on the rationale that a high percentage will have risk factors necessitating chemoradiotherapy postsurgery. There has been no systematic review to determine the best possible evidence in managing these cancers. Objectives To determine if primary surgery for stage IB2 cervical cancer (type II or type III radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy) improves survival compared to primary chemoradiotherapy. To determine if primary surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, for stage IB2 cervical cancer increases patient morbidity in the management of stage IB2 cervical cancer compared to primary chemoradiotherapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to April week 2, 2018) and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2018 week 16). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies up to April 2018. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‚ÄêRCTs or non‚Äêrandomised studies (NRSs) comparing surgery to chemoradiotherapy in stage IB2 cervical cancers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, abstracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We identified 4968 records from the literature searches, but we did not identify any RCTs that compared primary surgery with chemoradiotherapy in stage IB2 cervical cancer. We found one NRS comparing surgery to chemoradiotherapy in IB2 and IIA2 cervical cancers which met the inclusion criteria. However, we were unable to obtain data for stage IB2 cancers only and considered the findings very uncertain due to a high risk of selection bias. Authors' conclusions There is an absence of high‚Äêcertainty evidence on the relative benefits and harms of primary radical hysterectomy versus primary chemoradiotherapy for stage IB2 cervical cancer. More research is needed on the different treatment options in stage IB2 cervical cancer, particularly with respect to survival, adverse effects, and quality of life to facilitate informed decision‚Äêmaking and individualised care. Plain language summary Surgery or chemoradiotherapy for stage IB2 cervical cancer The issue  Treatment of cervical cancers that are larger than 4 cm still thought to be confined to the cervix (classified as stage IB2 cervical cancer) is controversial. Some clinicians believe that a combination of radiotherapy (high‚Äêenergy rays) and chemotherapy (anti‚Äêcancer drugs), together known as chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation, is better when the tumours are larger than 4 cm. This is based on the argument that the chance of the cancer returning after surgery is high, therefore most women will need chemoradiotherapy, even if they have surgery initially. The other school of thought is that these tumours are so large that they do not respond well to chemoradiotherapy and women with this stage of cervical cancer would benefit from surgery despite being at high risk of needing chemoradiotherapy after surgery. However, there are concerns about toxicity and complications related to the use of both surgery and chemoradiotherapy in women with cervical cancer, as receiving both treatments can increase morbidity. Therefore, many centres have moved towards providing only chemoradiotherapy. As there remains uncertainty about which treatment (surgery or chemoradiotherapy) is better for women with stage IB2 cervical cancer, we conducted this systematic review to try and answer this question.  How we conducted the review  We searched for evidence that compared chemoradiotherapy to surgery (type II or type III radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy) from 1946 to April 2018. We searched for both randomised controlled trials (where people taking part are put into groups at random) and non‚Äêrandomised studies (in which a defined group of people (the cohort) are followed over time).  What we found  We only found one non‚Äêrandomised study that compared surgery with chemoradiotherapy, but this study combined data on stages IB2 to IIA. Although it met the inclusion criteria, we could not analyse the data as we could not extract data specific to stage IB2 cervical cancers, therefore we considered the findings of this study to be uncertain with respect to our review question.  Conclusions  At present, there is no high‚Äêcertainty evidence to inform us of which of the current treatment options (chemoradiotherapy or radical surgery) is better for stage IB2 cervical cancer. Women with stage IB2 cervical cancer should be counselled regarding this uncertainty and potential side effects, and the choice of treatment should take into account the availability of the treatments in a particular health resource and patient preference. Ideally, a large multicentred trial is needed to determine which of the two treatments are better for treating women with stage IB2 cervical cancer. However, because of the relative rarity of stage 1B2 cancer, and the potential complications resulting from combining surgery and chemoradiotherapy, clinicians might continue to treat most women with chemoradiotherapy, and trials in this field might not be feasible.",Type II or type III radical hysterectomy compared to chemoradiotherapy as a primary intervention for stage IB2 cervical cancer,Nama and  V; Angelopoulos and  G; Twigg and  J; Murdoch and  JB; Bailey and  J; Lawrie and  TA,3,2,3,chemo+radio what do we think do we exclude???,3
CD002116.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Faecal incontinence (leakage of bowel motions or stool) is a common symptom which causes significant distress and reduces quality of life. Objectives To assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of faecal incontinence. In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of Trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 June 2012) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‚Äêrandomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. Main results Sixteen trials were identified, including 558 participants. Eleven trials were of cross‚Äêover design. Eleven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea, following ileoanal pouch or rectal surgery, or due to use of a weight‚Äêreducing drug). Two trials were amongst people with weak anal sphincters, one in participants with faecal impaction and bypass leakage, and one in geriatric patients. In one trial there was no specific cause for faecal incontinence. Seven trials tested anti‚Äêdiarrhoeal drugs to reduce faecal incontinence and other bowel symptoms (loperamide, diphenoxylate plus atropine, and codeine). Six trials tested drugs that enhance anal sphincter function (phenylepinephrine gel and sodium valproate). Two trials evaluated osmotic laxatives (lactulose) for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with constipation in geriatric patients. One trial assessed the use of zinc‚Äêaluminium ointment for faecal incontinence. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified. There was limited evidence that antidiarrhoeal drugs and drugs that enhance anal sphincter tone may reduce faecal incontinence in patients with liquid stools. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects (such as constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and nausea) than placebo. However, the dose may be titrated to the patient's symptoms to minimise side effects while achieving continence. The drugs acting on the sphincter sometimes resulted in local dermatitis, abdominal pain or nausea. Laxative use in geriatric patients reduced faecal soiling and the need for help from nurses. Zinc‚Äêaluminium ointment was associated with improved quality of life, with no reported adverse effects. However, the observed improvement in quality of life was seen in the placebo group as well as the treatment group. It should be noted that all the included trials in this review had small sample sizes and short duration of follow‚Äêup. 'Risk of bias' assessment was unclear for most of the domains as there was insufficient information. There were no data suitable for meta‚Äêanalysis. Authors' conclusions The small number of trials identified for this review assessed several different drugs in a variety of patient populations. The focus of most of the included trials was on the treatment of diarrhoea, rather than faecal incontinence. There is little evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of drug therapies for faecal incontinence. Larger, well‚Äêdesigned controlled trials, which use the recommendations and principles set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required. Plain language summary Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults Faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements or leakage of stool or faeces) is a common healthcare problem, affecting up to one in 10 of adults living at home. This affects daily activities in about one or two in 100 people. It is more common in people living in residential care. Leakage of urine often occurs as well. Faecal incontinence can be debilitating and embarrassing. Treatments include pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, surgery and drugs. This review looked at drugs for the treatment of faecal incontinence. These included anti‚Äêdiarrhoea drugs or laxatives to regulate stools, and drugs to try to enhance the tone of muscle around the anus which help to keep it closed. Sixteen small trials were found, including 558 participants. The review of these trials found some evidence that anti‚Äêdiarrhoea drugs may reduce faecal incontinence for people having liquid stools. However, these drugs were associated with some side effects. There was some evidence that drugs to enhance the tone of the muscle around the anus may help, but more research is needed.",Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults,Omar and  MI; Alexander and  CE,3,2,3,,3
