CD005029.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Disabling tremor or ataxia is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and up to 80% of patients experience tremor or ataxia at some point during their disease. A variety of treatments are available, ranging from pharmacotherapy or stereotactic neurosurgery to neurorehabilitation. Objectives To assess the efficacy and tolerability of both pharmacological and non‐pharmacologic treatments of ataxia in patients with MS. Search methods The following electronic resources were searched: Cochrane MS Group trials register (June 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (Jan 1988 to June 2006) and the National Health Service National Research Register (NRR) including the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Directory (Issue 2, 2006). Manual searches of bibliographies of relevant articles, pertinent medical and neurology journals and abstract books of major neurology and MS conferences (2001‐2006) were also performed. Direct communication with experts and drug companies was sought. Selection criteria Blinded, randomised trials which were either placebo‐controlled or which compared two or more treatments were included. Trials testing pharmacological agents must have had both participant and assessor blinding. Trials testing surgical interventions or effects of physiotherapy, where participants could not have been blinded to the treatment, must have had independent assessors who were blinded to the treatment. Cross‐over trials were included. Data collection and analysis Three independent reviewers extracted data and the findings of the trials were summarised. A meta‐analysis was not performed due to the inadequacy of outcome measures and methodological problems with the studies reviewed. Main results Ten randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Six placebo‐controlled studies (pharmacotherapy) and four comparative studies (one stereotactic neurosurgery and three neurorehabilitation) were reviewed. No standardised outcome measures were used across the studies. In general, pharmacotherapies were unrewarding and data on neurosurgery or rehabilitation is insufficient to lead to a change in practice. Authors' conclusions The absolute and comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapies to treat ataxia in MS are poorly documented and no recommendations can be made to guide prescribing. Although studies on neurosurgery and neurorehabilitation showed promising results, the absolute indications for treating with those methods cannot be developed. Standardised, well validated measures of ataxia and tremor need to be developed and employed in larger randomised controlled trials with careful blinding. Plain language summary The use of different treatment for incoordination of limb movement (ataxia) or tremor in people with multiple sclerosis MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system which typically affects both young and middle aged adults. It can result in many different symptoms including ataxia. In order to help these symptoms, several different treatments, such as physiotherapy, neurosurgery, and oral medications containing cannabis extract, isoniazid or baclofen have been used. The authors conducted a search of the medical literature and found that only 10 out of 59 studies met the criteria of minimum methodological quality necessary for inclusion in this review. These studies represented a total of 172 MS patients with ataxia. This review has found that there is not enough evidence to suggest that any treatment (drugs, physiotherapy or neurosurgery) provides sustained improvement in ataxia or tremor. More research is required.",Treatment for ataxia in multiple sclerosis,Mills and  RJ; Yap and  L; Young and  CA,1,3,,
CD013278.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to prevent or treat a PDA. There are concerns regarding adverse effects of NSAIDs in preterm infants. Controversy exists on whether early targeted treatment of a hemodynamically significant (hs) PDA improves clinical outcomes. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of early treatment strategies versus expectant management for an hs‐PDA in reducing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 31 May 2019), Embase (1980 to 31 May 2019), and CINAHL (1982 to 31 May 2019). An updated search was run on 2 October 2020 in the following databases: CENTRAL via CRS Web and MEDLINE via Ovid. We searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi‐randomized trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs in which early pharmacological treatment, defined as treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth, was compared to no intervention, placebo or other non‐pharmacological expectant management strategies for treatment of an hs‐PDA in preterm (< 37 weeks’ postmenstrual age) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) infants. Data collection and analysis We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality during hospital stay. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for selected clinical outcomes. Main results We included 14 RCTs that enrolled 910 infants. Seven RCTs compared early treatment (defined as treatment initiated by seven days of age) versus expectant management and seven RCTs compared very early treatment (defined as treatment initiated by 72 hours of age) versus expectant management. No difference was demonstrated between early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth) for an hs‐PDA for the primary outcome of ‘all‐cause mortality’ (6 studies; 500 infants; typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; typical RD ‐0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.03; moderate‐certainty evidence), or other important outcomes such as surgical PDA ligation (4 studies; 432 infants; typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.80; typical RD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.03; very low‐certainty evidence), chronic lung disease (CLD) (4 studies; 339 infants; typical RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.29; typical RD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.10 to 0.03; moderate‐certainty evidence), severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (2 studies; 171 infants; typical RR 0.83,95% CI 0.32 to 2.16; typical RD ‐0.01; 95% CI ‐0.08 to 0.06; low‐certainty evidence), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (5 studies; 473 infants; typical RR 2.34,95% CI 0.86 to 6.41; typical RD 0.04; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.08; low‐certainty evidence). Infants receiving early treatment in the first seven days after birth were more likely to receive any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (2 studies; 232 infants; typical RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.83; typical RD 0.57; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66; low‐certainty evidence). No difference was demonstrated between very early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first 72 hours after birth) for an hs‐PDA for the primary outcome of ‘all‐cause mortality’ (7 studies; 384 infants; typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.53; typical RD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.04; moderate‐certainty evidence) or other important outcomes such as surgical PDA ligation (5 studies; 293 infants; typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.17; typical RD ‐0.01; 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.02; moderate‐certainty evidence), CLD (7 studies; 384 infants; typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.08; typical RD ‐0.05; 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.04; low‐certainty evidence), severe IVH (4 studies, 240 infants; typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.93; typical RD ‐0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.04; moderate‐certainty evidence), NEC (5 studies; 332 infants; typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.21; typical RD 0.01; 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.06; moderate‐certainty evidence) and neurodevelopmental impairment (1 study; 79 infants; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31 for moderate/severe cognitive delay at 18 to 24 months; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.71 for moderate/severe motor delay at 18 to 24 months; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.78 for moderate/severe language delay at 18 to 24 months; low‐certainty evidence). Infants receiving very early treatment in the first 72 hours after birth were more likely to receive any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (4 studies; 156 infants; typical RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.05; typical RD 0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79; very low‐certainty evidence). Very early treatment, however, shortened the duration of hospitalization compared to expectant management (4 studies; 260 infants; MD ‐5.35 days; 95% CI ‐9.23 to ‐1.47; low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Early or very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of an hs‐PDA probably does not reduce mortality in preterm infants (moderate‐certainty evidence). Early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of hs‐PDA may increase NSAID exposure (low‐certainty evidence) without likely reducing CLD (moderate‐certainty evidence), severe IVH or NEC (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of hs‐PDA also increases NSAID exposure (very low‐certainty evidence). Very early treatment probably does not reduce surgical PDA ligation, severe IVH or NEC (moderate‐certainty evidence), and may not reduce CLD or neurodevelopmental impairment (low‐certainty evidence). Additional large trials that specifically include preterm infants at the highest risk of PDA‐attributable morbidity, are adequately powered for patient‐important outcomes and are minimally contaminated by open‐label treatment are required to explore if early targeted treatment of hs‐PDA improves clinical outcomes. There are currently two trials awaiting classification and two ongoing trials exploring this question. Plain language summary Early treatment versus expectant management of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants Review question Does early treatment (initiated within the first seven days after birth) or very early treatment (initiated within the first 72 hours after birth) of a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared to expectant management (without use of NSAIDs) improve outcomes in preterm infants? Background PDA is a common complication in preterm or low birth weight infants. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA often remains open and may contribute to life‐threatening complications. Medications such as NSAIDs are used to prevent or treat a PDA before it becomes symptomatic. However, there are concerns regarding the side‐effects of NSAIDs in preterm infants. There is controversy on whether early treatment of a symptomatic PDA improves outcomes in preterm infants. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‐birth‐weight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants with a symptomatic PDA diagnosed using a combination of specific clinical features and ultrasound of the heart. The included studies compared early treatment, or very early treatment of a symptomatic PDA with NSAIDs compared to expectant management without the use of NSAIDs. The search is up to date as of 2 October 2020. Key results This review of 14 clinical trials (910 infants) found that early or very early treatment of a symptomatic PDA does not reduce death or other poor clinical outcomes in preterm infants. Early or very early treatment, on the other hand, appears to increase the number of preterm infants exposed to NSAIDs. There are currently two trials awaiting classification and two ongoing trials exploring this question. Certainty of evidence According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to moderate but was moderate for the most important outcome of death.",Early treatment versus expectant management of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus for preterm infants,Mitra and  S; Scrivens and  A; von Kursell and  AM; Disher and  T,3,2,,
CD008107.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The outcome of patients with locally advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal (GE) junction, and stomach) is poor. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of perioperative chemotherapy on survival and other outcomes. Objectives To assess the effect of perioperative chemotherapy for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma on survival and other clinically relevant outcomes in the overall population of participants in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and in prespecified subgroups. Search methods We performed computerized searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Review of Effectiveness (DARE), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011), and LILACS (Literatura Latinoamericana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud), combining the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy with specific search terms. Moreover, we handsearched several online databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved papers. Selection criteria We included RCTs which randomized patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, in the absence of distant metastases, to receive either chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy followed by surgery, or surgery alone. Data collection and analysis Two independent review authors identified eligible trials. We solicited individual patient data (IPD) from all selected trials. We performed meta‐analyses based on intention‐to‐treat populations using the two‐stage method to combine IPD with aggregate data from RCTs for which IPD were unavailable. We combined data from all trials providing IPD in a Cox proportional hazards model to assess the effect of several covariables on overall survival. Main results We identified 14 RCTs with 2422 eligible patients. For eight RCTs with 1049 patients (43.3%), we were able to obtain IPD. Perioperative chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.89). This corresponds to a relative survival increase of 19% or an absolute survival increase of 9% at five years. This survival advantage was consistent across most subgroups. There was a trend towards a more pronounced treatment effect for tumors of the GE junction compared to other sites, and for combined chemoradiotherapy as compared to chemotherapy in tumors of the esophagus and GE junction. Resection with negative margins was a strong predictor of survival. Multivariable analysis showed that tumor site, performance status, and age have an independent significant effect on survival. Moreover, there was a significant interaction of the effect of perioperative chemotherapy with age (larger treatment effect in younger patients). Perioperative chemotherapy also showed a significant effect on several secondary outcomes. It was associated with longer disease‐free survival, higher rates of R0 resection, and more favorable tumor stage upon resection, while there was no association with perioperative morbidity and mortality. Authors' conclusions Perioperative chemotherapy for resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma increases survival compared to surgery alone. It should thus be offered to all eligible patients. There is a trend to a larger survival advantage for tumors of the GE junction as compared to other sites and for chemoradiotherapy as compared to chemotherapy in esophageal and GE junction tumors. Likewise, there is an interaction between age and treatment effect, with younger patients having a larger survival advantage, and no survival advantage for elderly patients. Plain language summary Chemotherapy before surgery in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, the gastroesophageal junction, and the stomach This systematic review uses the data of individual patients from eight and published data from another six randomized controlled trials. We found that the administration of chemotherapy before surgery leads to longer survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, the junction between esophagus and stomach, and the stomach. The findings suggest that patients whose tumor is in the junction between esophagus and stomach and younger patients benefit most from the chemotherapy. Moreover, the addition of radiation to the chemotherapy seems to yield an additional advantage to patients, at least in tumors of the esophagus and the junction between esophagus and stomach. Chemotherapy before surgery does not increase the risk of suffering a complication during or after surgery.","Perioperative chemo(radio)therapy versus primary surgery for resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, gastroesophageal junction, and lower esophagus",Ronellenfitsch and  U; Schwarzbach and  M; Hofheinz and  R; Kienle and  P; Kieser and  M; Slanger and  TE; Jensen and  K,1,3,,
CD005624.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence, causing varicose veins and venous insufficiency, makes up the majority of lower‐limb superficial venous diseases. Treatment options for GSV incompetence include surgery (also known as high ligation and stripping), laser and radiofrequency ablation, and ultrasound‐guided foam sclerotherapy. Newer treatments include cyanoacrylate glue, mechanochemical ablation, and endovenous steam ablation. These techniques avoid the need for a general anaesthetic, and may result in fewer complications and improved quality of life (QoL). These treatments should be compared to inform decisions on treatment for varicosities in the GSV. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011. Objectives To assess the effects of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), endovenous steam ablation (EVSA), ultrasound‐guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), cyanoacrylate glue, mechanochemical ablation (MOCA) and high ligation and stripping (HL/S) for the treatment of varicosities of the great saphenous vein (GSV). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED databases, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 November 2020. We undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) treating participants for varicosities of the GSV using EVLA, RFA, EVSA, UGFS, cyanoacrylate glue, MOCA or HL/S. Key outcomes of interest are technical success, recurrence, complications and QoL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, applied Cochrane's risk of bias tool, and extracted data. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We identified 11 new RCTs for this update. Therefore, we included 24 RCTs with 5135 participants. Duration of follow‐up ranged from five weeks to eight years. Five comparisons included single trials. For comparisons with more than one trial, we could only pool data for 'technical success' and 'recurrence' due to heterogeneity in outcome definitions and time points reported. All trials had some risk of bias concerns. Here we report the clinically most relevant comparisons. EVLA versus RFA Technical success was comparable up to five years (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.38; 5 studies, 780 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); over five years, there was no evidence of a difference (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.41; 1 study, 291 participants; low‐certainty evidence). One study reported recurrence, showing no clear difference at three years (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.99; 291 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but a benefit for RFA may be seen at five years (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.52 to 5.06; 291 participants; low‐certainty evidence). EVLA versus UGFS Technical success may be better in EVLA participants up to five years (OR 6.13, 95% CI 0.98 to 38.27; 3 studies, 588 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and over five years (OR 6.47, 95% CI 2.60 to 16.10; 3 studies, 534 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in recurrence up to three years and at five years (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.36; 2 studies, 443 participants; and OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.87; 2 studies, 418 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, respectively). EVLA versus HL/S Technical success may be better in EVLA participants up to five years (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.23; 6 studies, 1051 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No clear difference in technical success was seen at five years and beyond (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.50; 5 studies, 874 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Recurrence was comparable within three years and at 5 years (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.29; 7 studies, 1459 participants; and OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.76; 7 studies, 1267 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). RFA versus MOCA There was no clear difference in technical success (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.06 to 54.15; 3 studies, 435 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or recurrence (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.81; 3 studies, 389 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Long‐term data are not available. RFA versus HL/S No clear difference in technical success was detected up to five years (OR 5.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 50.81; 2 studies, 318 participants; low‐certainty evidence); over five years, there was no evidence of a difference (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.69; 1 study, 289 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No clear difference in recurrence was detected up to three years (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.51; 4 studies, 546 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); but a possible long‐term benefit for RFA was seen (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.75; 1 study, 289 participants; low‐certainty evidence). UGFS versus HL/S Meta‐analysis showed a possible benefit for HL/S compared with UGFS in technical success up to five years (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.94; 4 studies, 954 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and over five years (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30; 3 studies, 525 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No clear difference was detected in recurrence up to three years (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.77; 3 studies, 822 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and after five years (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.71; 3 studies, 639 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Complications were generally low for all interventions, but due to different definitions and time points, we were unable to draw conclusions (very‐low certainty evidence). Similarly, most studies evaluated QoL but used different questionnaires at variable time points. Rates of QoL improvement were comparable between interventions at follow‐up (moderate‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Our conclusions are limited due to the relatively small number of studies for each comparison and differences in outcome definitions and time points reported. Technical success was comparable between most modalities. EVLA may offer improved technical success compared to UGFS or HL/S. HL/S may have improved technical success compared to UGFS. No evidence of a difference was detected in recurrence, except for a possible long‐term benefit for RFA compared to EVLA or HL/S. Studies which provide more evidence on the breadth of treatments are needed. Future trials should seek to standardise clinical terminology of outcome measures and the time points at which they are measured. Plain language summary Which procedures are best for treating varicose veins in the leg? Key messages We are uncertain about which treatments are best for varicose veins because we found only a small number of studies that compared the different types of treatment, and because studies differed in how they measured results. ‐ All currently available varicose vein treatments are similar in terms of whether the treatment fully destroys the vein, or stops blood from pooling in the legs, or both (technical success). ‐ We need studies that provide more evidence on all the available treatments. What are varicose veins? Varicose veins are bulging, twisty veins close to the skin’s surface that usually occur in the legs. They are caused by chronic venous insufficiency, which is when your veins do not manage to help blood to flow back up to your heart efficiently, and blood pools in your legs. About one‐third of adults are thought to have chronic venous insufficiency. Women are more likely than men to have varicose veins. Varicose veins can be painful, itchy and unsightly, especially when standing and walking. Occasionally, they may result in skin changes or sores (ulcers) on the leg that take more than two weeks to heal. How are varicose veins treated? Varicose veins can be treated using a variety of procedures. Traditionally, surgery was used to remove the main surface vein (called the ‘great saphenous vein’, which runs from the groin to the ankle) and any connected varicose veins through small openings in the leg. People having this procedure (known as ‘high ligation and stripping’) need to have a general anaesthetic to make them unconscious and stop them from feeling pain or moving while the surgery is done. More recently, several treatments have emerged where the procedure is done inside the vein (endovenous), using a very fine tube. These treatments involve sealing the main vein in the thigh by deliberately damaging the vein wall. There are two main types of treatment: ‐ heat‐based, where heat energy from lasers, radio waves or steam, is used to damage the vein wall; ‐ chemical‐based, where chemicals (including foam or glue) are used to damage and consequently seal the vein. These newer treatments are done using a local anaesthetic, meaning you do not feel pain in your legs during the procedure but you remain awake. What did we want to find out? We wanted to compare all the currently available treatments for varicose veins to find out which is best in terms of: ‐ short‐ and long‐term technical success (whether the treatment fully destroys the vein, or stops blood from pooling in the legs, or both); ‐ stopping varicose veins from returning (recurrence); ‐ avoiding unwanted effects; and ‐ improving people’s well‐being. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared treatments for varicose veins in men and women of any age. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 24 studies that involved 5135 people with mild to severe varicose veins. The studies followed people for between 5 weeks to 8 years after their treatment. The majority of the people in the studies were women. The studies took place in private and public clinics and hospita",Interventions for great saphenous vein incompetence,Whing and  J; Nandhra and  S; Nesbitt and  C; Stansby and  G,3,2,,
CD004561.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Axillary surgery is an established part of the management of primary breast cancer. It provides staging information to guide adjuvant therapy and potentially local control of axillary disease. Several alternative approaches to axillary surgery are available, most of which aim to spare a proportion of women the morbidity of complete axillary dissection. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of alternative approaches to axillary surgery (including omitting such surgery altogether) in terms of overall survival; local, regional and distant recurrences; and adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Pre‐MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov on 12 March 2015 without language restrictions. We also contacted study authors and checked reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including women with clinically defined operable primary breast cancer conducted to compare axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with no axillary surgery, axillary sampling or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); RCTs comparing axillary sampling with SLNB or no axillary surgery; RCTs comparing SLNB with no axillary surgery; and RCTs comparing ALND with or without radiotherapy (RT) versus RT alone. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed each potentially relevant trial for inclusion. We independently extracted outcome data, risk of bias information and study characteristics from all included trials. We pooled data according to trial interventions, and we used hazard ratios (HRs) for time‐to‐event outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for binary outcomes. Main results We included 26 RCTs in this review. Studies were at low or unclear risk of selection bias. Blinding was not done, but this was only considered a source of bias for outcomes with potential for subjectivity in measurements. We found no RCTs of axillary sampling versus SLNB, axillary sampling versus no axillary surgery or SLNB versus no axillary surgery. No axillary surgery versus ALND  Ten trials involving 3849 participants compared no axillary surgery versus ALND. Moderate quality evidence showed no important differences between overall survival of women in the two groups (HR 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.17; 3849 participants; 10 studies) although no axillary surgery increased the risk of locoregional recurrence (HR ranging from 1.10 to 3.06; 20,863 person‐years of follow‐up; four studies). It was uncertain whether no surgery increased the risk of distant metastasis compared with ALND (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; 946 participants; two studies). Low‐quality evidence indicated no axillary surgery decreased the risk of lymphoedema compared with ALND (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.43; 1714 participants; four studies). Axillary sampling versus ALND  Six trials involving 1559 participants compared axillary sampling versus ALND. Low‐quality evidence indicated similar effectiveness of axillary sampling compared with ALND in terms of overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.21; 967 participants; three studies) but it was unclear whether axillary sampling led to increased risk of local recurrence compared with ALND (HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.12; 1404 participants; three studies). The relative effectiveness of axillary sampling and ALND for locoregional recurrence (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 406 participants; one study) and distant metastasis was uncertain (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 406 participants; one study). Lymphoedema was less likely after axillary sampling than after ALND (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81; 80 participants; one study). SLNB versus ALND  Seven trials involving 9426 participants compared SLNB with ALND. Moderate‐quality evidence showed similar overall survival following SLNB compared with ALND (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.25; 6352 participants; three studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Differences in local recurrence (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.77; 516 participants; one study), locoregional recurrence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.24; 5611 participants; one study) and distant metastasis (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.53; 516 participants; one study) were uncertain. However, studies showed little absolute difference in the aforementioned outcomes. Lymphoedema was less likely after SLNB than ALND (OR ranged from 0.04 to 0.60; three studies; 1965 participants; low‐quality evidence). Three studies including 1755 participants reported quality of life: Investigators in two studies found quality of life better after SLNB than ALND, and in the other study observed no difference. RT versus ALND  Four trials involving 2585 participants compared RT alone with ALND (with or without RT) .  High‐quality evidence indicated that overall survival was reduced among women treated with radiotherapy alone compared with those treated with ALND (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.21; 2469 participants; four studies), and local recurrence was less likely in women treated with radiotherapy than in those treated with ALND (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; 22,256 person‐years of follow‐up; four studies). Risk of distant metastasis was similar for radiotherapy alone as for ALND (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.25; 1313 participants; one study), and whether lymphoedema was less likely after RT alone than ALND remained uncertain (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.44; 200 participants; one study). Less surgery versus ALND  When combining results from all trials, treatment involving less surgery was associated with reduced overall survival compared with ALND (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16; 12,864 participants; 19 studies). Whether local recurrence was reduced with less axillary surgery when compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09; 24,176 participant‐years of follow up; eight studies). Locoregional recurrence was more likely with less surgery than with ALND (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.78; 26,880 participant‐years of follow‐up; seven studies). Whether risk of distant metastasis was increased after less axillary surgery compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.20; 2665 participants; five studies). Lymphoedema was less likely after less axillary surgery than with ALND (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46; 3964 participants; nine studies). No studies reported on disease control in the axilla. Authors' conclusions This review confirms the benefit of SLNB and axillary sampling as alternatives to ALND for axillary staging, supporting the view that ALND of the clinically and radiologically uninvolved axilla is no longer acceptable practice in people with breast cancer. Plain language summary Surgical removal of underarm lymph nodes in breast cancer Review question This review aimed to compare the benefits of surgical removal of underarm lymph nodes with the potential harms associated with this surgical procedure. The review also aimed to learn whether complete removal of all underarm nodes could be replaced by procedures that remove only a small number of lymph nodes. Background Surgical removal of underarm (axillary) lymph nodes is often part of the initial surgical treatment for patients with operable breast cancer. If cancer has spread to these lymph nodes, patients are advised to undergo additional treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, to help treat their disease. If cancer has not spread to these lymph nodes, patients are spared extra treatments (with extra side effects). Surgical removal of lymph nodes can lead to short‐term surgical complications (such as infection and wound healing problems) and long‐term problems (such as shoulder stiffness, pain and arm swelling (lymphoedema)) when fluid accumulation causes restricted function and discomfort. Modern strategies use a stepwise approach by first removing a small number of nodes and removing the others only if cancer is found at the first stage. This first stage can consist of ‘random’ axillary sampling, whereby the surgeon removes a small number of nodes (typically four) that can be felt. Alternatively, surgeons can use sentinel node techniques to identify those nodes most likely to contain cancer, leading to removal of as few nodes as possible. For patients with cancer in the sentinel nodes (or sample), complete removal of all underarm lymph nodes (axillary lymph node dissection) is usually recommended; however, radiotherapy to the axilla can also be given to obliterate any cancer cells in the lymph nodes. Some studies have explored alternative approaches such as no surgical treatment to the underarm nodes. Study characteristics The evidence is current to March 2015. The review identified 26 randomised controlled trials that compared axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with alternative approaches involving less axillary surgery. Patients in these trials had operable primary breast cancer, and some trials included patients with palpably enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Ten trials including 3849 patients compared ALND with no axillary surgery. Six trials including 1559 patients compared ALND with axillary sampling. Seven trials including 9426 patients compared ALND with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Four trials including 2585 patients compared ALND (with or without radiotherapy) with radiotherapy alone. Key results Moderate‐quality evidence suggests that patients treated with approaches involving lesser axillary surgery (such as axillary sampling or SLNB) do not have a reduced chance of survival compared with those treated with ALND. Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that overall survival is slightly reduced in patients who receive radiotherapy (but no axillary surgery) when compared with ALND. If survival is assumed to be 81% five years after surgery with ALND, then the evidence suggests it would be between 77% and 81% after treatment with radiotherapy alone.

CD012309.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a condition that results in the overflow of tears (epiphora) or infection of the nasolacrimal sac (dacryocystitis). The etiology of acquired NLDO is multifactorial and is not fully understood. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is the surgical correction of NLDO, which aims to establish a new drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nose. The success of DCR is variable; the most common cause of failure is fibrosis and stenosis of the surgical ostium. Antimetabolites such as mitomycin‐C (MMC) and 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) have been shown to be safe and effective in reducing fibrosis and improving clinical outcomes in other ophthalmic surgery settings (e.g. glaucoma and cornea surgery). Application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR has been studied, but the utility of these treatments remains uncertain. Objectives Primary objective:  To determine if adjuvant treatment with antimetabolites improves functional success in the setting of DCR compared to DCR alone. Secondary objectives:  To determine if anatomic success of DCR is increased with the use of antimetabolites, and if the surgical ostium is larger in participants treated with antimetabolites. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eye and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches. We last searched the electronic databases on 6 September 2019. Selection criteria We only included randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies were those that compared the administration of antimetabolites of any dose and concentration versus placebo or another active treatment in participants with NLDO undergoing primary DCR and reoperation. We only included studies that had enrolled adults 18 years or older. We also included studies that used silicone intubation as part of the DCR procedure. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies using an electronic data collection form. Main results We included 31 studies in the review, of which 23 (1309 participants) provided data relating to our primary and secondary outcomes. Many of the 23 studies evaluated functional success, while others also assessed our secondary outcomes of anatomic success or ostium size, or both. Study characteristics Participant characteristics varied across studies, with the age of participants ranging from 30 to 70 years. Participants were predominantly women. These demographics correspond to those most frequently affected by nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Almost all of the studies utilized MMC as the antimetabolite, with only one using 5‐FU. We assessed most trials as at unclear risk of bias for most domains. Conflicts of interest were not frequently reported, although the antimetabolites used are generic medications, and studies were not likely to be conducted for financial interest. Findings Twenty studies provided data on the primary outcome of functional success, of which 7 (356 participants) provided data at 6 months and 14 (909 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. At six months, the results showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on functional success (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.29; low‐certainty evidence). Beyond six months, the results favored the antimetabolite group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate‐certainty evidence). Fourteen studies reported data on the secondary outcome of anatomic success, of which 4 (306 participants) reported data at 6 months and 12 (831 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. Results at six months showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on anatomic success (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low‐certainty evidence). Beyond six months, participants in the antimetabolite group were more likely to achieve anatomic success than those receiving DCR alone (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.15; moderate‐certainty evidence). At six months and beyond six months follow‐up, two studies reported mean change in ostium size. We did not conduct meta‐analysis for the various follow‐up periods due to clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. However, point estimates from these studies at six months consistently favored participants in the antimetabolite group (low‐certainty evidence). Beyond six months, while point estimates from one study favored participants in the antimetabolite group, estimates from another study showed no evidence of a difference between the two groups. The certainty of evidence at both time points was low. Adverse events Adverse events were rare. One study reported that one participant in the MMC group experienced delayed wound healing. Other studies reported no significant adverse events related to the application of antimetabolites. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐certainty evidence that application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR increases functional and anatomic success of DCR when patients are followed for more than six months after surgery, but no evidence of a difference at six months, low‐certainty of evidence. There is low‐certainty evidence that combining antimetabolite with DCR increases the size of the lacrimal ostium at six months. However, beyond six months, the evidence remain uncertain. Adverse effects of the application of antimetabolites were minimal. Plain language summary Antimetabolites as an adjunct to dacryocystorhinostomy for nasolacrimal duct obstruction What is the aim of the review?  Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a type of surgery that creates a new tear drainage pathway between the eyelid and nose to relieve tearing symptoms (functional success), improve openness of the tear duct to irrigation (anatomic success), and increase the size of the opening into the nose (ostium size). Our aim was to assess whether antiscarring medications (antimetabolites) can increase the functional success, anatomic success, and ostium size of DCR. Key results  We found that antimetabolites may improve functional and anatomic success (relative to DCR alone) at a follow‐up time longer than six months. Antimetabolites may also improve ostium size at six months. What was studied in the review?  The lacrimal system of the eye produces tears, which nourish the eye surface and keep it moist. After passing along the eye surface, tears drain into the nose through the lacrimal drainage apparatus. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is the blockage of this canal, which can cause an overflow of tears. NLDO is usually painless and can affect one or both eyes. NLDO can also lead to infection of the eye. NLDO is treated surgically with a procedure known as dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), which establishes a new pathway by creating a pathway between the tear sac and the nose. Antimetabolites have been used to improve success rates of this procedure. We wanted to learn whether DCR in combination with antimetabolites can improve outcomes for functional success, anatomic success, and ostium size than DCR alone. We collected and analyzed all relevant randomized controlled trials to answer this question. What are the main results of the review?  We identified 31 relevant studies for inclusion, most of which originated in South and East Asia and involved predominantly women. These studies compared participants who underwent DCR with metabolites versus participants who underwent DCR alone. Twenty‐three of these studies (1309 participants) provided data on our outcomes of interest. DCR with antimetabolites may improve functional and anatomic success when patients are followed more than six months after surgery; the certainty of this evidence was moderate. There was no difference in functional and anatomic success at six months among participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites compared to participants who underwent DCR alone; the certainty of evidence is low. At six months, participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites may have increased ostium size compared to those receiving DCR alone. However, beyond six months, there is no evidence of a difference between participants who underwent DCR with antimetabolites compared to participants who underwent DCR alone. The certainty of the evidence was low due to substantial variability among the studies that assessed this outcome. Adverse effects of antimetabolites were minimal. How up‐to‐date is this review?

CD012470.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Wrist fractures, involving the distal radius, are the most common fractures in children. Most are buckle fractures, which are stable fractures, unlike greenstick and other usually displaced fractures. There is considerable variation in practice, such as the extent of immobilisation for buckle fractures and use of surgery for seriously displaced fractures. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for common distal radius fractures in children, including skeletally immature adolescents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and reference lists to May 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing interventions for treating distal radius fractures in children. We sought data on physical function, treatment failure, adverse events, time to return to normal activities (recovery time), wrist pain, and child (and parent) satisfaction. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence for each outcome. Main results Of the 30 included studies, 21 were RCTs, seven were quasi‐RCTs and two did not describe their randomisation method. Overall, 2930 children were recruited. Typically, trials included more male children and reported mean ages between 8 and 10 years. Eight studies recruited buckle fractures, five recruited buckle and other stable fractures, three recruited minimally displaced fractures and 14 recruited displaced fractures, typically requiring closed reduction, typically requiring closed reduction. All studies were at high risk of bias, mainly reflecting lack of blinding. The studies made 14 comparisons. Below we consider five prespecified comparisons: Removable splint versus below‐elbow cast for predominantly buckle fractures (6 studies, 695 children)  One study (66 children) reported similar Modified Activities Scale for Kids ‐ Performance scores (0 to 100; no disability) at four weeks (median scores: splint 99.04; cast 99.11); low‐quality evidence. Thirteen children needed a change or reapplication of device (splint 5/225; cast 8/219; 4 studies); very low‐quality evidence. One study (87 children) reported no refractures at six months. One study (50 children) found no between‐group difference in pain during treatment; very low‐quality evidence. Evidence was absent (recovery time), insufficient (children with minor complications) or contradictory (child or parent satisfaction). Two studies estimated lower healthcare costs for removable splints. Soft or elasticated bandage versus below‐elbow cast for buckle or similar fractures (4 studies, 273 children)  One study (53 children) reported more children had no or only limited disability at four weeks in the bandage group; very low‐quality evidence. Eight children changed device or extended immobilisation for delayed union (bandage 5/90; cast 3/91; 3 studies); very low‐quality evidence. Two studies (139 children) reported no serious adverse events at four weeks. Evidence was absent, insufficient or contradictory for recovery time, wrist pain, children with minor complications, and child and parent satisfaction. More bandage‐group participants found their treatment convenient (39 children). Removal of casts at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (2 studies, 404 children, mainly buckle fractures) One study (233 children) found full restoration of physical function at four weeks; low‐quality evidence. There were five treatment changes (home 4/197; hospital 1/200; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence). One study found no serious adverse effects at six months (288 children). Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in pain at four weeks (233 children); low‐quality evidence. One study (80 children) found greater parental satisfaction in the home group; low‐quality evidence. One UK study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. Below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts for displaced or unstable both‐bone fractures (4 studies, 399 children) Short‐term physical function data were unavailable but very low‐quality evidence indicated less dependency when using below‐elbow casts. One study (66 children with minimally displaced both‐bone fractures) found little difference in ABILHAND‐Kids scores (0 to 42; no problems) (mean scores: below‐elbow 40.7; above‐elbow 41.8); very low‐quality evidence. Overall treatment failure data are unavailable, but nine of the 11 remanipulations or secondary reductions (366 children, 4 studies) were in the above‐elbow group; very low‐quality evidence. There was no refracture or compartment syndrome at six months (215 children; 2 studies). Recovery time and overall numbers of children with minor complications were not reported. There was little difference in requiring physiotherapy for stiffness (179 children, 2 studies); very low‐quality evidence. One study (85 children) found less pain at one week for below‐elbow casts; low‐quality evidence. One study found treatment with an above‐elbow cast cost three times more in Nepal. Surgical fixation with percutaneous wiring and cast immobilisation versus cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures (5 studies, 323 children) Where reported, above‐elbow casts were used. Short‐term functional outcome data were unavailable. One study (123 children) reported similar ABILHAND‐Kids scores indicating normal physical function at six months (mean scores: surgery 41.9; cast only 41.4); low‐quality evidence. There were fewer treatment failures, defined as early or problematic removal of wires or remanipulation for early loss in position, after surgery (surgery 20/124; cast only 41/129; 4 studies; very low‐quality evidence). Similarly, there were fewer serious advents after surgery (surgery 28/124; cast only 43/129; 4 studies; very low‐quality evidence). Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There was lower referral for physiotherapy for stiffness after surgery (1 study); very low‐quality evidence. One USA study found similar treatment costs in both groups. Authors' conclusions Where available, the quality of the RCT‐based evidence on interventions for treating wrist fractures in children is low or very low. However, there is reassuring evidence of a full return to previous function with no serious adverse events, including refracture, for correctly‐diagnosed buckle fractures, whatever the treatment used. The review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for these injuries. High‐quality evidence is needed to address key treatment uncertainties; notably, some priority topics are already being tested in ongoing multicentre trials, such as FORCE. Plain language summary Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children Background and aim Wrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‐elbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‐elbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). We aimed to assess the best‐quality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. Results of the search We searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. Key results Six studies compared a removable splint with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. Four studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). Two studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. Four studies compared below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts in usually displaced fractures.

CD007444.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Cervical priming before first‐trimester surgical abortion is recommended in certain groups of women. Nitric oxide (NO) donors induce cervical ripening without uterine contractions, but the efficacy and side effects are of concern. Objectives To evaluate NO donors for cervical ripening before first‐trimester surgical abortion, in terms of efficacy, side effects, and reduction of complications. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and POPLINE. We also searched reference lists of retrieved papers. We contacted experts in the field for information on both published and unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing NO donors alone or in combination with other methods for cervical ripening in first‐trimester surgical abortion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected and extracted the data onto a data extraction form. We processed the data using Review Manager ( RevMan 5 ) software. Main results We included 9 studies involving 766 participants. There were no serious complications (infection requiring antibiotic treatment, blood transfusion, complications requiring unintended operation, cervical injury, uterine perforation, death or serious morbidity) in the included trials. NO donors were more effective in cervical ripening when compared with placebo or no treatment. Baseline cervical dilatation before the procedure was higher in NO donors group (mean difference (MD) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.58) The cumulative force required to dilate the cervix to 8 mm (MD ‐4.29, 95% CI ‐9.92 to 1.35), headache (risk ratio (RR) 1.73, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.46), abdominal pain (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.50), or patient satisfaction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07) were not different. More nausea and vomiting occurred in the women who received a NO donor (RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.45). NO donors were inferior to prostaglandins for cervical ripening. The cumulative force required to dilate the cervix to 8 mm to 9 mm was higher (MD 13.12, 95% CI 9.72 to 16.52), and baseline cervical dilatation was less (MD ‐0.73, 95% CI ‐1.01 to ‐0.45) in the NO donor group. However, the probability of dilation greater than 8 mm at three hours was higher in the NO donor group (RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.21 to 20.09). Side effects including headache (RR 5.13, 95% CI 3.29 to 8.00), palpitation (RR 3.43, 95% CI 1.64 to 7.15), dizziness (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.46 to 7.41), and intraoperative blood loss (MD 33.59 ml, 95% CI 24.50 to 42.67) were also higher. However, abdominal pain (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.44) and vaginal bleeding (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27) were less in the NO donor group. No difference for nausea/vomiting in both groups(RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.46). Patient satisfaction was not different. One trial compared a NO donor with a NO donor plus prostaglandin. The cumulative force required to dilate the cervix to 8 mm was higher (MD 14.50, 95% CI 0.50 to 28.50) in the NO donor group. There was no difference in headache (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.00), abdominal pain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.07), or intraoperative blood loss (MD ‐50, 95% CI ‐164.19 to 64.19). Authors' conclusions NO donors are superior to placebo or no treatment, but inferior to prostaglandins for first‐trimester cervical ripening, and associated with more side effects.

CD006931.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Vitreoretinal surgeons proposed submacular surgery to remove the fibrovascular tissue causing damage to the centre of the retina, in the attempt to limit central visual loss in people affected by neovascular age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). Objectives This review aims at assessing the effectiveness of submacular surgery for preserving or improving vision in patients with AMD. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 11 February 2009. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing submacular surgery with any other treatment or observation. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data. The risk ratio (RR) of visual loss and visual gain was estimated at one year. Main results Two multicentre studies with a similar design were conducted between 1997 and 2003 and compared submacular surgery with observation in people affected by subfoveal neovascular AMD with (n=336) or without (n=454) extensive blood in the macula. At one year there was high quality evidence of no benefit for preventing visual loss (RR: 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84 to 1.09). No difference could be demonstrated regarding the chance of visual gain (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.51), although this evidence was of low quality because of imprecision. The risk difference was ‐2% (95% CI: ‐10% to 5%) and 1% (95% CI: ‐4% to 6%) for visual loss and visual gain, respectively, thus excluding a large benefit with surgery in terms of absolute risk in this sample. There was high quality evidence that cataract needing surgery (RR: 8.69; 95% CI: 4.06 to 18.61) and retinal detachment (RR: 6.13; 95% CI: 2.81 to 13.38) were more common among operated patients, and detachment occurred in 5% of patients with no extensive blood and in 18% of those with extensive blood beneath the macula. A pilot study compared submacular surgery with laser photocoagulation in 70 patients. No difference between the two treatments could be demonstrated for any outcome measure, but estimates were very imprecise because of small sample size. Authors' conclusions There is no benefit with submacular surgery in most people with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation due to AMD in terms of prevention of visual loss. Furthermore, the risk of developing cataract and retinal detachment increases after surgery. Plain language summary Surgical removal of choroidal neovascularisation in patients with neovascular age‐related macular degeneration Neovascular or wet age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is caused by blood vessels growing as a layer of tissue under the central retina (the macula). The disease leads to the development of a blind spot in the centre of the visual field and is the most common cause of legal blindness among the elderly in the western world. Surgery has been used to remove tissue lying beneath the macula, within which grow the small, new blood vessels which are the cause of wet AMD. It was hoped that removal of this tissue might limit the development of AMD, and perhaps even improve vision.  We found two large multicentre studies conducted in 790 people affected by choroidal neovascularisation, with or without extensive blood beneath the macula. The results of these studies suggested that visual loss cannot be prevented using surgery. In addition, complications such as cataract and retinal detachment can arise during follow‐up, in patients who have the procedure.",Submacular surgery for choroidal neovascularisation secondary to age‐related macular degeneration,Giansanti and  F; Eandi and  CM; Virgili and  G,3,2,,
CD010261.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The distal tibial metaphysis is located in the lower (distal) part of the tibia (shin bone). Fractures of this part of the tibia are most commonly due to a high energy injury in young men and to osteoporosis in older women. The optimal methods of surgical intervention for a distal tibial metaphyseal fracture remain uncertain. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical interventions for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. We planned to compare surgical versus non‐surgical (conservative) treatment, and different methods of surgical intervention. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (9 December 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1946 to November Week 3 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 Week 48), the Airiti Library (1967 to 2014 Week 8), China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (1915 to 2014 Week 8), ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2014) and reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies comparing surgical versus non‐surgical (conservative) treatment or different surgical interventions for treating distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. Our primary outcomes were patient‐reported function and the need for secondary or revision surgery or substantive physiotherapy because of adverse outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias in each study and extracted data. We resolved disagreement by discussion and, where necessary, in consultation with a third author. Where appropriate we pooled data using the fixed‐effect model. Main results We included three randomised trials that evaluated intramedullary nailing versus plating in 213 participants, with useable data from 173 participants of whom 112 were male. The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 41 to 44 years. There were no trials comparing surgery with non‐surgical treatment. The three included trials were at high risk of performance bias, with one trial also being at high risk of selection, detection and attrition bias. Overall, the quality of available evidence was rated as very low for all outcomes, meaning that we are very unsure about the estimates for all outcomes. Although the pooled results of three different measures of foot and ankle function indicated a small difference in favour of nailing (standard mean difference 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.59; 172 participants, 3 trials), the results of individual trials indicated that this was very unlikely to be a clinically important difference. Pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the need for reoperation or substantive physiotherapy for adverse events favoured nailing (4/90 versus 10/83; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.12), but included the possibility of a better outcome after plating. Based on an illustrative risk of 100 re‐operations for adverse outcomes within one year of plate fixation in 1000 people with these fractures, 63 fewer (95% CI 88 fewer to 12 more) people per 1000 would have re‐operations after nailing. Similarly pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the symptomatic nonunion or malunion, wound complications and fracture union favoured nailing but the 95% confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect and thus included the possibility of a better outcome after plating. Evidence from one trial (85 participants) showed no clinically important difference in pain between the two groups. Authors' conclusions Overall, there is either no or insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the use of surgery or the best surgical intervention for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. The available evidence, which is of very low quality, found no clinically important differences in function or pain, and did not confirm a difference in the need for re‐operation or risk of complications between nailing and plating. The addition of evidence from two ongoing trials of nailing versus plating should inform this question in future updates. Further randomised trials are warranted on other issues, but should be preceded by research to identify priority questions. Plain language summary Surgical interventions for treating distal tibial fractures (breaks of the lower end of the shin bone) in adults Background Breaks in the lower (distal) end of the shin bone (or tibia) are mostly caused by high‐energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents. We set out to compare surgical treatment (such as putting the broken parts back into position and fixing these either by inserting a metal nail into the central cavity of the bone (nailing) or with a metal plate and securing it to the bone using screws (plating)) with non‐surgical treatment (plaster cast immobilisation). We also set out to compare different methods of surgery such as nailing versus plating. Study characteristics We searched medical databases and trials registries in December 2014. We wanted to include studies in which receiving one surgical treatment or another surgical treatment was decided by chance. This research method, termed a randomised controlled trial (RCT), is the best way to ensure that any measured improvement is caused by the treatment itself and no other factors. We found three RCTs involving 213 adults (with results available from 173) that compared nailing versus plating for treating distal tibial fractures. Overall the studies included around twice as many males as females and the average age of the study participants was just over 40 years. We found no trials comparing surgery with non‐surgical treatment. Key results We found no clear differences between the nailing and plating groups in terms of patient‐reported functional outcomes, re‐operations for adverse outcomes, troublesome non‐healing of the bone or deformity, pain, wound problems such as infection, or the numbers of individuals with healed fractures. Quality of the evidence Only three trials were identified and the sample sizes were small, so the results are imprecise. Moreover, the results of one trial were very likely to be biased due to flawed methodology. We therefore judged the overall quality of evidence to be very low, which means that we are very unsure of these results. Conclusions Overall, the evidence is of very low quality and is insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the best method of surgery, including nailing versus plating, for treating breaks of the lower end of the shin bone in adults. Future updates of this review are likely to include evidence from currently ongoing research comparing nailing versus plating. Although other RCTs are needed to address key clinical questions on surgical methods for treating these fractures, these studies should be preceded by research to determine which questions should be prioritised.",Surgical interventions for treating distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults,Kuo and  LT; Chi and  CC; Chuang and  CH,3,3,,
CD008470.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The annual incidence of ankle fractures is 122 per 100,000 people. They usually affect young men and older women. The question of whether surgery or conservative treatment should be used for ankle fractures remains controversial. Objectives To assess the effects of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ankle fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library , 2012 Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Current Controlled Trials. Date of last search: 6 February 2012. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies comparing surgical and conservative treatments for ankle fractures in adults were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Authors of the included studies were contacted to obtain original data. Main results Three randomised controlled trials and one quasi‐randomised controlled trial were included. These involved a total of 292 participants with ankle fractures. All studies were at high risk of bias from lack of blinding. Additionally, loss to follow‐up or inappropriate exclusion of participants put two trials at high risk of attrition bias. The trials used different and incompatible outcome measures for assessing function and pain. Only limited meta‐analysis was possible for early treatment failure, some adverse events and radiological signs of arthritis. One trial, following up 92 of 111 randomised participants, found no statistically significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment in patient‐reported symptoms (self assessed ankle 'troubles': 11/43 versus 14/49; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.76) or walking difficulties at seven years follow‐up. One trial, reporting data for 31 of 43 randomised participants, found a statistically significantly better mean Olerud score in the surgically treated group but no difference between the two groups in pain scores after a mean follow‐up of 27 months. A third trial, reporting data for 49 of 96 randomised participants at 3.5 years follow‐up, reported no difference between the two groups in a non‐validated clinical score. Early treatment failure, generally reflecting the failure of closed reduction (criteria not reported in two trials) probably or explicitly leading to surgery in patients allocated conservative treatment, was significantly higher in the conservative treatment group (2/116 versus 19/129; RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.54). Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the reported complications. Pooled results from two trials of participants with radiological signs of osteoarthritis at averages of 3.5 and 7.0 years follow‐up showed no between‐group differences (44/66 versus 50/75; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.31). Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude whether surgical or conservative treatment produces superior long‐term outcomes for ankle fractures in adults. The identification of several ongoing randomised trials means that better evidence to inform this question is likely to be available in future. Plain language summary Surgical versus conservative treatment for ankle fractures in adults Each year, one in every 800 people break (fracture) their ankles. Such injuries typically happen to young men and older women. Ankle fractures can be treated surgically or conservatively (non‐surgically). Surgery involves an operation to expose the fracture to reposition the broken parts of the bone and then fix them in place using wires, pins, screws and other devices. Treatment after surgery varies but may also include the use of a plaster cast. Conservative treatment involves repositioning of the fractured bone by manipulating it through the skin, followed by immobilisation of the ankle in a plaster cast for several weeks. This review aimed to find out whether surgery or conservative treatment gives a better long‐term outcome for people with these injuries. This review included four trials, involving a total of 292 participants. All four trials had flawed methods that could affect the reliability of their findings. No data could be pooled for long‐term measures of function or pain. The largest trial found no evidence of differences between surgery and conservative treatment in patient‐reported symptoms or walking difficulties at seven years follow‐up. The second trial found better results for the surgical group for function but not pain at 27 months, while the third trial reported no difference between the two groups in clinical outcome at 3.5 years. In all four trials, there were some patients in the conservative treatment group who were treated surgically because the repositioning of the fractured bone was judged unsuccessful. Otherwise, there were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the reported complications nor in radiological signs of osteoarthritis. Overall, there was not enough reliable evidence to draw conclusions about whether surgery or conservative treatment is more appropriate for treating broken ankles in adults.",Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating ankle fractures in adults,Donken and  CCMA; Al‐Khateeb and  H; Verhofstad and  MHJ; van Laarhoven and  CJHM,3,2,,
CD004439.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Chronic osteomyelitis is generally treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement but can persist intermittently for years with frequent therapeutic failure or relapse. Despite advances in both antibiotic and surgical treatment, the long‐term recurrence rate remains around 20%. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009. Objectives To determine the effects of different systemic antibiotic treatment regimens for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1948 to September Week 4 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to 2012 Week 40), LILACS (October 2012), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (June 2012) and reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs addressing the effects of different antibiotic treatments given after surgical debridement for chronic osteomyelitis in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion, extracted data and appraised risk of bias in the included trials. Where appropriate, we pooled data using the fixed‐effect model. Main results We included eight small trials involving a total of 282 participants with chronic osteomyelitis. Data were available from 248 participants. Most participants were male with post‐traumatic osteomyelitis, usually affecting the tibia and femur, where recorded. The antibiotic regimens, duration of treatment and follow‐up varied between trials. All trials mentioned surgical debridement before starting on antibiotic therapy as part of treatment, but it was unclear in four trials whether all participants underwent surgical debridement. We found that study quality and reporting were often inadequate. In particular, we judged almost all trials to be at moderate to high risk of bias due to failure to conceal allocation and inadequate follow‐up. Four trials compared oral versus parenteral route for administration of antibiotics. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission at the end of treatment (70/80 versus 58/70; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.18; four trials, 150 participants). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission rate 12 or more months after treatment (49/64 versus 44/54; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13; three trials, 118 participants). There was also no significant difference between the two groups in the occurrence of mild adverse events (11/64 versus 8/54; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.42; three trials, 118 participants) or moderate and severe adverse events (3/49 versus 4/42; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.57; three trials, 91 participants). Superinfection occurred in participants of both groups (5/66 in the oral group versus 4/58 in the parenteral group; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60; three trials, 124 participants). Single trials with few participants found no statistical significant differences for remission or adverse events for the following four comparisons: oral only versus parenteral plus oral administration; parenteral plus oral versus parenteral only administration; two different parenteral antibiotic regimens; and two different oral antibiotic regimens. No trials compared different durations of antibiotic treatment for chronic osteomyelitis, or adjusted the remission rate for bacteria species or severity of disease. Authors' conclusions Limited and low quality evidence suggests that the route of antibiotic administration (oral versus parenteral) does not affect the rate of disease remission if the bacteria are susceptible to the antibiotic used. However, this and the lack of statistically significant differences in adverse effects need confirmation. No or insufficient evidence exists for other aspects of antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis. The majority of the included trials were conducted over 20 years ago and currently we are faced with a far higher prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to many of the available antibiotics used for healthcare. This continuously evolving bacterial resistance represents another challenge in the choice of antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis. Plain language summary Antibiotics for treating chronic bone infection in adults Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of the bone and bone marrow caused by pus‐forming bacteria, mycobacteria or fungi. All bone infection that is long‐standing is called chronic osteomyelitis. People with this condition are treated with systemic antibiotics, which can be given by mouth or parenterally (i.e. by injection into the muscle or vein). This review is an update of our previous 2009 publication. We included eight small randomised trials involving 282 people. The trials presented results for a total of 248 people with chronic osteomyelitis. Post‐traumatic bone infections were the most frequent type. Surgical removal of the infected tissue (debridement) before starting on antibiotic therapy was mentioned as part of treatment in all trials, but in four trials it was unclear whether all participants underwent surgery. There were five comparisons of different treatments but we could only pool results for the comparison of antibiotic given by mouth with antibiotic given parenterally. The pooled results (which included data from 150 people) did not show any difference between people given antibiotics by mouth or parenterally in terms of the number of people who did not have symptoms (in 'remission') at the end of treatment (four trials) or 12 months later (or more) (three trials); nor in the number of people that had negative side effects or had a superinfection (another infection that is not sensitive to antibiotic treatment). This evidence suggests that the way antibiotics are given does not impact on the disease remission rate if the bacteria causing the infection are sensitive to the antibiotic used. However, confirmation is needed. There was either no or insufficient evidence on which to base judgements about the optimum length of antibiotic treatment or the best antibiotics to use.",Antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults,Conterno and  LO; Turchi and  MD,3,2,,
CD010241.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Heavy menstrual bleeding is one of the most common reasons for referral of premenopausal women to a gynaecologist. Although medical therapy is generally first line, many women eventually will require further treatment. Endometrial ablation by hysteroscopic and more recent 'second‐generation' devices such as balloon, radiofrequency or microwave ablation offers a day‐case surgical alternative to hysterectomy. Complete endometrial destruction is one of the main determinants of treatment success. Surgery is most effective if undertaken when endometrial thickness is less than four millimeters. One option is to perform the surgery in the immediate postmenstrual phase, which is not always practical. The other option is to use hormonal agents that induce endometrial thinning pre‐operatively. The most commonly evaluated agents are goserelin (a gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone analogue, or GnRHa) and danazol. Other GnRH analogues and progestogens have also been studied, although fewer data are available. It has been suggested that these agents will reduce operating time, improve the intrauterine operating environment and reduce absorption of fluid used for intraoperative uterine cavity distension. They may also improve long‐term outcomes, including menstrual loss and dysmenorrhoea. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness and safety of pre‐operative endometrial thinning agents (GnRH agonists, danazol, estrogen‐progestins and progestogens) versus another agent or placebo when given before endometrial destruction in premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Search methods The following electronic databases were searched to April 2013 for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria: the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register of controlled trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Other electronic sources of trials included trial registers for ongoing and registered trials; citation indexes; conference abstracts in the Web of Knowledge; the LILACS database for trials from the Portuguese‐ and Spanish‐speaking world; PubMed; and the OpenSIGLE database and Google for grey literature. All searches were performed in consultation with the MDSG Trials Search Co‐ordinator. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they compared the effects of these agents with one other, or with placebo or no treatment, on relevant intraoperative and postoperative treatment outcomes. Selection of trials was carried out independently by two review authors. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for risk of bias and extracted data on surgical outcomes, effectiveness outcomes, proportion of women requiring further surgical therapy during follow‐up, endometrial outcome measures, acceptability of use outcomes and quality of life. Data were analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Dichotomous data were combined for meta‐analysis with RevMan software using the Mantel‐Haenszel method to estimate pooled risk ratios (RRs). Continuous data were combined for meta‐analysis with RevMan software using an inverse variance method to estimate the pooled mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The overall quality of evidence for the main findings was assessed with the use of GRADE working group methods. Main results Twenty studies with 1969 women were included in this review. These studies compared GnRHa, danazol and progestogens versus placebo or no treatment; GnRHa versus danazol, progestogens, GnRH antagonists or dilatation & curettage; and danazol versus progestogens. Four studies performed more than one comparison. When compared with no treatment, GnRHa used before hysteroscopic resection were associated with a higher rate of postoperative amenorrhoea at 12 months (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.0, 7 RCTs, 605 women, moderate heterogeneity; I 2  = 40%) and at 24 months (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.52, 2 RCTs, 357 women, no heterogeneity; I 2  = 0%), a slightly shorter duration of surgery (‐3.5 minutes, 95% CI ‐4.7 to ‐2.3, 5 RCTs, 156 women, substantial heterogeneity; I 2  = 72%) and greater ease of surgery (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.46, 2 RCTs, 415 women, low heterogeneity; I 2  = 4%). Postoperative dysmenorrhoea was reduced (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.87, 2 RCTs, 133 women, no heterogeneity; I 2  = 0%). The use of GnRHa had no effect on intraoperative complication rates (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.06, 5 RCTs, 592 women, no heterogeneity; I 2  = 0%), and participant satisfaction with this surgery was high irrespective of the use of pre‐operative endometrial thinning agents (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05, 6 RCTs, 599 women, low heterogeneity; I 2  = 11%). GnRHa produced more consistent endometrial atrophy than was produced by danazol (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.75, 2 RCTs, 142 women, no heterogeneity; I 2  = 0%). For other intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, any differences were minimal, and no benefits of GnRHa pretreatment were noted in studies in which women underwent second‐generation ablation techniques. Both GnRHa and danazol produced side effects in a significant proportion of women, although few studies reported these in detail. Few randomised data were available to allow assessment of the effectiveness of progestogens as endometrial thinning agents. When reported, the long‐term effects of endometrial thinning agents on benefits such as postoperative amenorrhoea were reduced with time. The main study weaknesses were that most participants received no follow‐up beyond 24 months and that the studies used a small sample size. Heterogeneity for outcomes reported ranged from none to substantial. More than half the trials had no blinding of participants or outcome assessment. Most of the trials were determined to have uncertain selection and reporting bias, as they did not report allocation concealment and evidence of selective reporting was noted. The quality of reporting of adverse events was generally poor, but, when described in the studies, they included menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, hirsutism, decreased libido and voice changes, as well as other side effects such as headache and weight gain. Authors' conclusions Low‐quality evidence suggests that endometrial thinning with GnRHa and danazol before hysteroscopic surgery improves operating conditions and short‐term postoperative outcomes. GnRHa produced slightly more consistent endometrial thinning than was produced by danazol, although both achieved satisfactory results. The effect of these agents on longer‐term postoperative outcomes was reduced with time. No benefits of GnRHa pretreatment were apparent with second‐generation ablation techniques. Also, side effects were more common when these agents were used. Plain language summary Pre‐operative endometrial thinning agents before endometrial destruction for heavy menstrual bleeding Review Question Cochrane authors reviewed evidence for the effectiveness and safety of medications used to thin the lining of the womb before surgery performed to destroy (ablate) this lining (endometrium) in premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Background Heavy menstrual bleeding is one of the most common reasons why premenopausal women are referred to a gynaecologist; this condition can cause significant physical, emotional and social stress in a woman's life. Surgery to ablate the endometrium is a treatment option available for this condition that is less invasive than removal of the womb (i.e. hysterectomy). We wanted to discover whether using medications to thin the lining of the womb before endometrial destruction enhanced the effectiveness of surgery in reducing symptoms and improved operating conditions for the surgeon. We also wanted to evaluate the safety of these medications (i.e. observe whether side effects or surgical complications were increased). These medications included gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues), danazol and progestogens. Endometrial destruction surgery included either the older 'hysteroscopic' technique, whereby the lining of the womb is destroyed under direct vision, or the newer second‐generation techniques, which include balloon, radiofrequency and microwave ablation. Study Characteristics The evidence is current to April 2013. The review included 20 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1969 premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding for whom non‐surgical treatment had not worked. Studies compared GnRH analogues, danazol and progestogens versus placebo or no treatment; GnRH analogues versus danazol, progestogens, GnRH antagonists or dilatation & curettage; and danazol versus progestogens. Four studies performed more than one comparison. Three studies used the newer second‐generation surgical techniques for endometrial destruction. Key Results GnRH analogues and danazol used before hysteroscopic surgery improve both operating conditions for the surgeon and short‐term bleeding symptoms for women (up to 24 months after surgery). GnRH analogues thin the lining of the womb better and more consistently than danazol, although both agents produce satisfactory results. Adverse effects were more common in women taking GnRH analogues or danazol compared with no treatment, and this was especially true with danazol. Adverse effects included menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, hirsutism, decreased libido and voice changes, as well as other side effects such as headache and weight gain. The use of medications to thin the lining of the womb before surgery does not appear to improve heavy menstrual bleeding in the long term (i.e. longer than 24 months). However, only a few small studies followed up with women for longer than 24 months. Also, medications given to thin the womb lining do not p",Pre‐operative endometrial thinning agents before endometrial destruction for heavy menstrual bleeding,Tan and  YH; Lethaby and  A,3,2,,
CD007585.PUB4,"Abstract - Background This is an update of a previous Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2010 and updated in Issue 9, 2015. The role of lymphadenectomy in surgical management of endometrial cancer remains controversial. Lymph node metastases can be found in approximately 10% of women who before surgery are thought to have cancer confined to the womb. Removal of all pelvic and para‐aortic lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) at initial surgery has been widely advocated, and pelvic and para‐aortic lymphadenectomy remains part of the FIGO (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) staging system for endometrial cancer. This recommendation is based on data from studies that suggested improvement in survival following pelvic and para‐aortic lymphadenectomy. However, these studies were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not confer a direct therapeutic benefit, other than allocating women to poorer prognosis groups. Furthermore, the Cochrane review and meta‐analysis of RCTs of routine adjuvant radiotherapy to treat possible lymph node metastases in women with early‐stage endometrial cancer found no survival advantage. Surgical removal of pelvic and para‐aortic lymph nodes has serious potential short‐term and long‐term sequelae. Therefore, it is important to investigate the clinical value of this treatment. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to June 2009 for the original review, updated the search to June 2015 for the last updated version and further extended the search to March 2017 for this version of the review. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria RCTs and quasi‐RCTs that compared lymphadenectomy versus no lymphadenectomy in adult women diagnosed with endometrial cancer . Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and progression‐free survival and risk ratios (RRs) comparing adverse events in women who received lymphadenectomy versus those with no lymphadenectomy were pooled in random‐effects meta‐analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Main results 978 unique references were identified via the search strategy. All but 50 were excluded by title and abstract screening. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria; for one small RCT, data were insufficient for inclusion in the meta‐analysis. The two RCTs included in the analysis randomly assigned 1945 women, reported HRs for survival adjusted for prognostic factors and based on 1851 women and had an overall low risk of bias, as they satisfied four of the assessment criteria. The third study had an overall unclear risk of bias, as information provided was not adequate concerning random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, or completeness of outcome reporting. Results of the meta‐analysis remained unchanged from the previous versions of this review and indicated no differences in overall and recurrence‐free survival between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.43; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.58 for overall and recurrence‐free survival, respectively) (1851 participants, two studies; moderate‐quality evidence). We found no difference in risk of direct surgical morbidity between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy. However, women who underwent lymphadenectomy had a significantly higher risk of surgery‐related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.27; RR 8.39, 95% CI 4.06 to 17.33 for risk of surgery‐related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation, respectively) (1922 participants, two studies; high‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions This review found no evidence that lymphadenectomy decreases risk of death or disease recurrence compared with no lymphadenectomy in women with presumed stage I disease. Evidence on serious adverse events suggests that women who undergo lymphadenectomy are more likely to experience surgery‐related systemic morbidity or lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation. Currently, no RCT evidence shows the impact of lymphadenectomy in women with higher‐stage disease and in those at high risk of disease recurrence. Plain language summary The role of removing lymph nodes as part of standard surgery for endometrial cancer The issue  Cancer of the lining of the womb (endometrial cancer) is now the most common gynaecological cancer among women in western Europe and North America. Most of these women (75%) have tumours confined to the body of the womb at the time of diagnosis, and three‐quarters of women will survive for 10 years after diagnosis. Lymph node metastases can be found in one in 10 women who appear to have cancer confined to the womb at the time of diagnosis, and removal of all pelvic and para‐aortic lymph nodes has been advocated, even for women with presumed early‐stage cancer. This recommendation is based on non‐randomised studies that suggested improvement in survival following removal of pelvic and para‐aortic lymph nodes. However, treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not be beneficial, and additional treatment to lymph nodes might not necessarily be better treatment, especially as surgical removal of lymph nodes has serious potential short‐term and long‐term harmful effects. The aim of the review  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of lymphadenectomy in the management of endometrial cancer. What are the main findings?  We found only three trials that compared lymphadenectomy with no lymphadenectomy among women with endometrial cancer. One of these trials could not be included in the meta‐analysis of this review, as it provided insufficient information about outcomes for women. When we combined findings from the two remaining trials, which included 1945 women, we found no evidence that women who received lymphadenectomy were less likely to die or have a relapse of their cancer. In addition, severe adverse events experienced as a consequence of lymphadenectomy outnumbered those reported when no lymphadenectomy was performed. Quality of the evidence  The overall quality of the evidence for lymphadenectomy versus standard surgery was moderate for survival outcomes and adverse events (other than evidence for presence or absence of lymphoedema or lymphocyst, which was of high quality). The quality of evidence for quality of life was very low, as this outcome was not reported. What are the conclusions?  The uncertainty of whether lymphadenectomy or no lymphadenectomy is best in the management of early‐stage endometrial cancer probably reflects the fact that evidence shows no reduction in death or in disease relapse when lymphadenectomy is performed, rather than lack of evidence. In addition, women undergoing lymphadenectomy experienced more severe adverse events than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy.",Lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer,Frost and  JA; Webster and  KE; Bryant and  A; Morrison and  J,3,2,,
CD002764.PUB2,"Abstract - Background This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2000. Intestinal obstruction commonly occurs in progressive advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancers. Management of these patients is difficult due to the patients' deteriorating mobility and function (performance status), the lack of further chemotherapeutic options, and the high mortality and morbidity associated with palliative surgery. There are marked variations in clinical practice concerning surgery in these patients between different countries, gynaecological oncology units and general hospitals, as well as referral patterns from oncologists under whom these patients are often admitted. Objectives To assess the efficacy of surgery for intestinal obstruction due to advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer. Search methods We searched the following databases for the original review in 2000 and again for this update in June 2015: CENTRAL (2015, Issue 6); MEDLINE (OVID June week 1 2015); and EMBASE (OVID week 24, 2015). We also searched relevant journals, bibliographic databases, conference proceedings, reference lists, grey literature and the world wide web for the original review in 2000; we also used personal contact. This searching of other resources yielded very few additional studies. The Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Review Group no longer routinely handsearch journals. For these reasons, we did not repeat the searching of other resources for the June 2015 update. Selection criteria As the review concentrates on the 'best evidence' available for the role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction in known advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer we kept the inclusion criteria broad (including both prospective and retrospective studies) so as to include all studies relevant to the question. We sought published trials reporting on the effects of surgery for resolving symptoms in malignant bowel obstruction for adult patients with known advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer. Data collection and analysis We used data extraction forms to collect data from the studies included in the review. Two review authors extracted the data independently to reduce error. Owing to concerns about the risk of bias we decided not to conduct a meta‐analysis of data and we have presented a narrative description of the study results. We planned to resolve disagreements by discussion with the third review author. Main results In total we have identified 43 studies examining 4265 participants. The original review included 938 patients from 25 studies. The updated search identified an additional 18 studies with a combined total of 3327 participants between 1997 and June 2015. The results of these studies did not change the conclusions of the original review. No firm conclusions can be drawn from the many retrospective case series so the role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction remains controversial. Clinical resolution varies from 26.7% to over 68%, though it is often unclear how this is defined. Despite being an inadequate proxy for symptom resolution or quality of life, the ability to feed orally was a popular outcome measure, with success rates ranging from 30% to 100%. Rates of re‐obstruction varied, ranging from 0% to 63%, though time to re‐obstruction was often not included. Postoperative morbidity and mortality also varied widely, although again the definition of both of these surgical outcomes differed between many of the papers. There were no data available for quality of life. The reporting of adverse effects was variable and this has been described where available. Where discussed, surgical procedures varied considerably and outcomes were not reported by specific intervention. Using the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool, most included studies were at high risk of bias for most domains. Authors' conclusions The role of surgery in malignant bowel obstruction needs careful evaluation, using validated outcome measures of symptom control and quality of life scores. Further information could include re‐obstruction rates together with the morbidity associated with the various surgical procedures. Currently, bowel obstruction is managed empirically and there are marked variations in clinical practice by different units. In order to compare outcomes in malignant bowel obstruction, there needs to be a greater degree of standardisation of management. Since the last version of this review none of the new included studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. Plain language summary Surgery for resolving symptoms associated with malignant bowel obstruction in advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancers Background Advanced cancer causes a range of complex problems for patients. In gynaecological (for example ovarian and womb) and gastrointestinal (for example colon or bowel) cancers, the bowel can become blocked or obstructed by the original tumour, metastatic deposits or due to the side effects of previous treatments. The decision to operate on patients with bowel obstruction who are already very unwell because of their advanced cancer is difficult. Often, these people develop bowel obstruction as a sign that the cancer is progressing and they are in the process of dying. When the bowel obstructs in this situation, surgery might be useful for some patients, it might make no difference to how long the patient has to live, or it might make the situation worse due to the complications of surgery. When time is short, managing symptoms and maximising comfort for the patient is the priority. Different surgical teams adopt different approaches. We wanted to establish the evidence for the benefit and harm of surgery in these situations and therefore help patients and doctors make good decisions. Key findings and quality of the evidence We first looked at the evidence in 2000 and this is an update of the original review. In total we found 43 studies examining 4265 people. We looked at adults with advanced gynaecological or gastrointestinal cancer who developed bowel obstruction and had either surgical or non‐surgical treatment. The studies we found were of low quality and measured success and benefit in different ways. It was therefore not possible to compare these studies and conclude whether surgery was of benefit or harm in this situation. Research in this area is problematic and the type of study needed to answer this question would be very difficult to conduct.",Surgery for the resolution of symptoms in malignant bowel obstruction in advanced gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer,Cousins and  SE; Tempest and  E; Feuer and  DJ,3,2,,
CD007119.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Central venous catheters (CVCs) facilitate the administration of intravenous drugs, fluids, blood products and parenteral nutrition to patients with either chronic disease or critical illness. Despite a pivotal role within medical management, a common complication associated with CVC use is occlusion of the CVC lumen(s). CVC occlusion can interrupt and cause serious delays in administration of treatment interventions. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of different interventions used to restore patency of occluded CVC lumens, in adults and children. Search methods We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 9); OvidSP MEDLINE (1950 to September 2011); OvidSP EMBASE (1980 to September 2011) and NHS Evidence CINAHL (1982 to September 2011). We also searched clinical trial registers, handsearched reference lists, contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of publications that met the inclusion criteria to identify trials. Selection criteria We selected randomized controlled trials which investigated the efficacy of an intervention (chemical, surgical or drug) used to restore patency to an occluded CVC lumen, in either adults or children. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently assessed those studies that met the inclusion criteria for quality and extracted the relevant data using a standardized form. Main results No studies were found that investigated the efficacy and safety of either chemical or surgical interventions. Seven studies (eight papers) with a total of 632 participants were identified from the search. They investigated different comparisons, strengths of thrombolytic or anticoagulant drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion thought to be caused by a thrombus. There was low quality evidence from a meta‐analysis of two studies suggesting that urokinase (various strengths) was more effective than placebo for restoring patency to occluded CVC lumens in adults and children with underlying medical conditions (relative risk (RR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47 to 2.95), with a number needed to treat of 4 (95% CI 2 to 8). There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the safety of urokinase. The overall quality of the evidence provided by these studies was low to very low due to one or more domains being assessed as either at 'unclear risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias'. Furthermore, the total number of participants in these studies was small and consequently may lead to spurious results. Authors' conclusions There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta‐analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted. Plain language summary Interventions for restoring patency of occluded central venous catheter lumens A central venous catheter is a small, hollow tube that is inserted into a large vein in either the chest, neck or groin. Central venous catheters enable healthcare professionals to administer drugs and other fluids directly into the blood stream, in order to treat critically ill patients or those patients with a long‐term condition. In certain chronic conditions, patients or their carers may also be involved with the administration of treatment interventions via the central venous catheter. Occasionally, the catheter lumens can become blocked with either a blood clot or a treatment intervention solidifying in the tube, or due to the position of the tube inside the vein. If the catheter does become blocked it may mean that the patient has to undergo further surgery to remove and replace the blocked catheter. No studies were found investigating the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions (brush, snare or guidewire exchange) or chemical interventions (hydrochloric acid, sodium bicarbonate, 70% ethanol solution) to unblock the catheter. Our search identified seven studies (eight papers), with a total of 632 participants, that investigated different drug comparisons or compared different strengths of drug therapies for treating catheters that were either completely or partially blocked with a blood clot. This review has found low to very low quality evidence suggesting that thrombolytic drugs (urokinase and alteplase) could be effective in unblocking central venous catheter lumens blocked by blood clots. However, the total number of participants included in these trials was small and consequently the results of the analysis may well be over exaggerated. There were also issues with the way the studies were conducted that could possibly have introduced bias. In conclusion, more research is required to establish the efficacy and safety of different treatment interventions used to unblock occluded central venous catheter lumens. Particularly, there is a need for studies exclusively in children.",Interventions for restoring patency of occluded central venous catheter lumens,van Miert and  C; Hill and  R; Jones and  L,3,2,,
CD008509.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Ureteral colic is a common reason for patients to seek medical care. Alpha‐blockers are commonly used to improve stone passage through so‐called medical expulsive therapy (MET), but their effectiveness remains controversial. This is an update of a 2014 Cochrane review; since that time, several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant. Objectives To assess effects of alpha‐blockers compared with standard therapy for ureteral stones 1 cm or smaller confirmed by imaging in adult patients presenting with symptoms of ureteral stone disease. Search methods On 18 November 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP to identify all published/unpublished and ongoing trials. We checked all references of included and review articles and conference proceedings for articles relevant to this review. We sent letters to investigators to request information about unpublished or incomplete studies. Selection criteria We included RCTs of ureteral stone passage in adult patients that compared alpha‐blockers versus standard therapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened studies for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures. We performed meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. Primary outcomes were stone clearance and major adverse events; secondary outcomes were stone expulsion time, number of pain episodes, use of diclofenac, hospitalisation, and surgical intervention. We assessed the quality of evidence on a per‐outcome basis using the GRADE approach. Main results We included 67 studies with 10,509 participants overall. Of these, 15 studies with 5787 participants used a placebo. Stone clearance: Based on the overall analysis, treatment with an alpha‐blocker may result in a large increase in stone clearance (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 1.55; low‐quality evidence). A subset of higher‐quality, placebo‐controlled trials suggest that the likely effect is probably smaller (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate‐quality evidence), corresponding to 116 more (95% CI 51 more to 182 more) stone clearances per 1000 participants. Major adverse events: Based on the overall analysis, treatment with an alpha‐blocker may have little effect on major adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.96; low‐quality evidence). A subset of higher‐quality, placebo‐controlled trials suggest that alpha‐blockers likely increase the risk of major adverse events slightly (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.86), corresponding to 29 more (95% CI 3 more to 75 more) major adverse events per 1000 participants. Patients treated with alpha‐blockers may experience shorter stone expulsion times (mean difference (MD) ‐3.40 days, 95% CI ‐4.17 to ‐2.63; low‐quality evidence), may use less diclofenac (MD ‐82.41, 95% CI ‐122.51 to ‐42.31; low‐quality evidence), and likely require fewer hospitalisations (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.77; moderate‐quality evidence), corresponding to 69 fewer hospitalisations (95% CI 93 fewer to 32 fewer) per 1000 participants. Meanwhile, the need for surgical intervention appears similar (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02; low‐quality evidence), corresponding to 28 fewer surgical interventions (95% CI 51 fewer to 2 more) per 1000 participants. A predefined subgroup analysis (test for subgroup differences; P = 0.002) suggests that effects of alpha‐blockers may vary with stone size, with RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.15; P = 0.16; I² = 62%) for stones 5 mm or smaller versus 1.45 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.72; P < 0.0001; I² = 59%) for stones larger than 5 mm. We found no evidence suggesting possible subgroup effects based on stone location or alpha‐blocker type. Authors' conclusions For patients with ureteral stones, alpha‐blockers likely increase stone clearance but probably also slightly increase the risk of major adverse events. Subgroup analyses suggest that alpha‐blockers may be less effective for smaller (5 mm or smaller) than for larger stones (greater than 5 mm). Plain language summary Alpha‐blockers for ureteral stones in adult patients with symptoms of stone disease Review question Does medical treatment with alpha‐blockers improve the outcomes of patients with stones stuck in their ureter? Background Stones stuck in the ureter, which is the tube that transports urine from the kidney to the bladder, often cause pain and make people see a doctor. Depending on which part of the ureter the stone is stuck in and the size of the stone, it will often pass into the bladder on its own over the course of weeks. If the stone does not come out by itself, people often need to have procedures done to remove the stone. Alpha‐blockers are medications that relax muscles in the urinary tract and may make the stone pass into the bladder faster. However, they can cause unwanted effects. We updated an existing Cochrane Review from 2014 to look into the effects of alpha‐blockers. Study characteristics Based on our latest search of the literature from November 2017, we included 64 studies with 10,509 participants. Of these, 15 studies compared alpha‐blockers with placebo with 5787 participants. A placebo is a pill that looks and tastes exactly like the real medication, so participants did not know what they were getting. These were the higher‐quality studies, which we trusted more. Key results Based on the subset of higher‐quality studies that used a placebo, alpha‐blockers likely resulted in more people passing their stones. However, these patients are likely to experience slightly more serious unwanted effects of this medication. People taking alpha‐blockers may pass their stones in a shorter time, may use less diclofenac (which is a type of pain medication), and are likely to be admitted to the hospital less often. Meanwhile, the need for surgery for their stones was similar. Upon completing additional analyses, we found that effects of alpha‐blockers may be different in people with small (5 mm or smaller) versus larger (larger than 5 mm) stones. It appears that this medication works better in people with larger stones. We could find no difference in how well alpha‐blockers work, no matter where in the ureter the stone is stuck or what type of alpha‐blocker is used. Authors' conclusions For patients with stones stuck in the ureter, alpha‐blockers likely make passing the stone easier but cause slightly more unwanted effects. It appears that alpha‐blockers work better in people with larger (greater than 5 mm) rather than smaller (5 mm or smaller) stones. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence for most outcomes was moderate or low, meaning that we have moderate or low confidence in most of the reported results.",Alpha‐blockers as medical expulsive therapy for ureteral stones,Campschroer and  T; Zhu and  X; Vernooij and  RWM; Lock and  MTWT,3,2,,
CD007340.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly recognised as a condition associated with overweight or obesity that may progress to end‐stage liver disease. NAFLD histology resembles alcohol‐induced liver injury, but occurs in patients with no history of alcohol abuse. NAFLD has a broad spectrum of clinical and histological manifestations, ranging from simple fatty liver to hepatic steatosis with inflammation, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The inflammatory stage is known as non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Recent reports indicate that weight loss induced by bariatric procedures could be beneficial for NASH treatment. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of bariatric surgery for NASH in obese patients. Search methods We searched  The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register , the  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  ( CENTRAL ) in  The Cochrane Library ,  MEDLINE ,  EMBASE,  and  Science Citation Index Expanded  to October 2009. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials evaluating any bariatric procedure versus no intervention, placebo (sham procedure), or other interventions in patients with NASH regardless of publication status, number of patients randomised, language, or blinding. Quasi‐randomised clinical studies were to be considered for the review if no randomised clinical trials were identified. If included, their bias towards positive findings was to be considered. Data collection and analysis We extracted data in duplicate, and we planned to analyse the data by intention‐to‐treat. Main results We could not find any randomised clinical trials or quasi‐randomised clinical studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Our search resulted in twenty‐one prospective or retrospective cohort studies, in which improvement on steatosis or inflammation scores was reported. However, four studies also described some deterioration in the degree of fibrosis. Authors' conclusions The lack of randomised clinical trials and quasi‐randomised clinical studies precludes us to assess the benefits and harms of bariatric surgery as a therapeutic approach for patients with NASH. Limitations of all other studies with inferior design did not allow us to draw any unbiased conclusion on bariatric surgery for treatment of NASH. Plain language summary Bariatric surgery for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis in obese patients Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome in which obesity and resistance to the insulin action are the hallmark. Fat accumulation in the liver produces inflammation and chronic liver damage, known as non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Nowadays, the best strategy to treat NAFLD and NASH is weight loss. Surgical procedures to treat obesity (bariatric surgery) have shown good results to reduce fat accumulation and even improve other obesity‐related conditions. However, neither the benefits nor the harms of bariatric surgery in NASH have been assessed in any systematic review or meta‐analysis of randomised clinical trials. The present Cochrane review attempted to evaluate the benefits and risks of bariatric surgery for NASH in obese patients, but as no randomised clinical trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the review protocol were found, the review was not able to address the pre‐specified in the protocol aims. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies reported on beneficial effects on steatosis and inflammation, with potential increase of liver fibrosis, but the studies were too heterogenous and with a small number of patients. Hence, the data, which the latter studies contained, are with a high risk of bias, and a reliable summary of their data cannot be achieved. Due to the absence of trials, well‐designed randomised trials to assess bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment of NASH are required.",Bariatric surgery for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis in obese patients,Chavez‐Tapia and  NC; Tellez‐Avila and  FI; Barrientos‐Gutierrez and  T; Mendez‐Sanchez and  N; Lizardi‐Cervera and  J; Uribe and  M,1,3,,
CD013085.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction, or a combination of these with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It can result in a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options or therapies for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) is a relatively cheap option and potentially efficient way to deliver physical therapy for people with CVI. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Clinical Trials.gov trials register to August 2018. We searched the LILACS and IBECS databases. We also checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy with no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed studies retrieved by the search strategies. Both review authors independently assessed selected studies for complete analysis. We resolved conflicts through discussion. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, obtaining additional information. For binary outcomes (leg ulcer incidence and adverse events), we presented the results using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes (disease severity, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), pain, oedema, skin pigmentation), we presented the results as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. Main results We included seven randomised controlled trials with 891 participants (outpatients in secondary care). We found no quasi‐randomised controlled trials. Six studies (836 participants) evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment. One study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug ( melilotus officinalis ) (55 participants). There was a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, imprecision and inconsistency, which downgraded the certainty of the evidence. For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison, there probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptom score as assessed using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (MD –1.66, 95% CI –4.14 to 0.83; 2 studies, 484 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably resulted in a moderate improvement in HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CVIQ2) at three months (MD –9.38, 95% CI –18.18 to –0.57; 2 studies, 149 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), nine months (MD –10.46, 95% CI –11.81 to –9.11; 1 study; 55 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and 12 months (MD –4.99, 95% CI –9.19 to –0.78; 2 studies, 455 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in HRQoL between balneotherapy and no treatment at six months (MD –1.64, 95% CI –9.18 to 5.89; 2 studies, 445 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably slightly improved pain compared with no treatment (MD –1.23, 95% CI –1.33 to –1.13; 1 study; 390 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no clear effect related to oedema between the two groups at 24 days (MD 43.28 mL, 95% CI –102.74 to 189.30; 2 studies, 153 participants; very‐low certainty evidence). There probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in the incidence of leg ulcers (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.48; 2 studies, 449 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was probably a reduction in incidence of skin pigmentation changes in favour of balneotherapy at 12 months (pigmentation index: MD –3.59, 95% CI –4.02 to –3.16; 1 study; 59 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The main complications reported included erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), thromboembolic events (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study; 59 participants; low‐certainty evidence), with no clear evidence of an increase in reported adverse effects with balneotherapy. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies. For the balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug ( melilotus officinalis ) comparison, we observed no clear difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study; 35 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study; 35 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). This single study did not report on the other outcomes of interest. Authors' conclusions We identified moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence that suggests that balneotherapy may result in a moderate improvement in pain, quality of life and skin pigmentation changes and has no clear effect on disease severity signs and symptoms score, adverse effects, leg ulcers and oedema when compared with no treatment. For future studies, measurements of outcomes such as disease severity sign and symptom score, quality of life, pain and oedema and choice of time points during follow‐up must be standardised for adequate comparison between trials. Plain language summary Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) Background Chronic venous insufficiency is a disease caused by abnormal transport of blood into the veins of the lower limbs, which means the veins cannot pump enough blood back to the heart. This condition is defined by several signs, with gnarled and enlarged veins being the most common and venous ulcers being the most severe. There is a wide variety of management options or therapies for chronic venous insufficiency, ranging from surgery and medicine, to compression (applying force) and physical therapies. Balneotherapy is a possible way to deliver physical therapy for people with chronic venous insufficiency. Balneotherapy is a traditional medical technique that involves water and is usually practiced in spas. It consists of the immersion in mineral water or mud loaded with minerals. It may or may not include exercise. Alone or combined with usual care, balneotherapy may provide a significant improvement in the quality of life of people with chronic venous insufficiency when compared with usual care alone. Study characteristics We identified seven randomised controlled trials (studies in which the participants were divided between treatment groups through random method) (most recent search August 2018). Six studies compared balneotherapy versus no treatment, and one study compared balneotherapy versus a medicine called  melilotus officinalis . The studies used different types of balneotherapy and different treatment times. Key results and certainty of the evidence For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison there probably is no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptoms score (moderate‐certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably improves health‐related quality of life and pain (moderate‐certainty evidence). There probably is no improvement in favour of balneotherapy for leg ulcers (moderate‐certainty evidence). There is no clear effect related to oedema (swelling caused when fluid leaks out of the body's tiny blood vessels) between balneotherapy and no treatment (very low‐certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably reduces skin pigmentation changes (low‐certainty evidence). None of the studies reported any serious adverse events. There were fewer side effects (infection and blood clots in the legs) in people receiving balneotherapy compared to no treatment. When comparing balneotherapy with  melilotus officinalis , there were insufficient data to detect clear differences between the two treatments for pain and oedema in the single small study. There were no data available for the other outcomes of interest such as disease severity signs and symptoms score, quality of life, leg ulcers and skin pigmentation. The certainty of the evidence was affected by the small number of trials with few participants and the impossibility of blinding of participants and physicians conducting the balneotherapy treatment, which could have led to bias.",Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency,de Moraes Silva and  MA; Nakano and  LCU; Cisneros and  LL; Miranda Jr and  F,3,2,,
CD006087.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Fractures of the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non‐surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach. Objectives The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non‐surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013),  meta Register of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random‐effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors. Main results Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF™ and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient‐oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post‐operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post‐operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I 2  = 0%). Similarly, no difference in post‐operative infection between the use of two 3‐dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I 2  = 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events. Authors' conclusions This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances. Plain language summary Treatments for fractures of the lower jaw Review question The lower jaw (also known as the mandible) is an important bone that shapes the face, holds the lower teeth in place and is used to move the mouth, for talking and chewing food. Fractures are most often found in the part of the lower jaw that supports teeth (known as the body), the part where the jaw curves upwards into the neck (the angle), or at the knobbly‐shaped joint found at the very top of the jaw bone (the condyle). Available treatments align and stabilize the fracture, allowing the bone to heal in the proper position. Treatments may or may not involve surgery. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines different methods for treating fractures of the body and angle of the mandible in existing research and studies. Background People of all ages can fracture their lower jaw, but fractures mainly occur as a result of violence (for example, being hit or punched in the jaw) or by being involved in an accident on the road (for example, car crashes or bicycle accidents). These fractures can be stabilized by physically binding the jaw shut with a system of bars, wires or elastic bands (intermaxillary fixation), or by using tiny screws or plates attached directly to the fractured sections of the lower jaw bone whilst still allowing the mouth to open (rigid fixation). Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 28 February 2013. Twelve studies with a combined total of 689 participants were included in this review. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 68 years and most participants (90%) were male. All of the studies compared different types of surgical treatments, and each study evaluated a different aspect of surgical treatment such as different types of plates, screws, or wires or how long the jaw was immobilized after surgery. Key results There were concerns about the design and quality of all the studies. All the studies evaluated different aspects of surgical treatment. None of the studies evaluated non‐surgical treatments such as intermaxillary fixation and no study compared surgical treatment with non‐surgical treatment. As a result there is no clear evidence to indicate which approach is the best to manage these fractures. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence found is poor. Recommendations are made for further well‐conducted research studies in this area to be undertaken.",Interventions for the management of mandibular fractures,Nasser and  M; Pandis and  N; Fleming and  PS; Fedorowicz and  Z; Ellis and  E; Ali and  K,3,2,,
CD009959.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Frey's syndrome is a rare disorder, the symptoms of which include sweating, flushing and warming over the preauricular and temporal areas following a gustatory stimulus. It often occurs in patients who have undergone parotidectomy, submandibular gland surgery, radical neck dissection, infection and traumatic injury in the parotid region, and is caused by the aberrant regrowth of facial autonomic nerve fibres. Currently there are several options used to treat patients with Frey's syndrome; for example, the topical application of anticholinergics and antiperspirants, and the intradermal injection of botulinum toxin. It is uncertain which treatment is most effective and safe. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of different interventions for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 28 April 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in participants diagnosed with Frey's syndrome using a clinical standard such as Minor's starch‐iodine test. We planned to include trials in which participants received any intervention versus no treatment (observation) or an alternative intervention, with or without a second active treatment. Our primary outcome measures were success rate (as assessed clinically by Minor's starch‐iodine test, the iodine‐sublimated paper histogram method, blotting paper technique or another method) and adverse events. Our secondary outcome measure was success rate as assessed by patients (disappearance or improvement of symptoms). Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We identified no RCTs or quasi‐RCTs that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Our searches retrieved eight potentially relevant studies, but after assessment of the full‐text reports we excluded all of them due to the absence of randomisation or because the patients did not have Frey's syndrome. We excluded one randomised controlled trial that compared two different doses of botulinum toxin in patients with Frey's syndrome because the comparator was not an alternative treatment. Authors' conclusions We are unable to establish the efficacy and safety of the different methods used for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. RCTs are urgently needed to assess the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. Future RCTs should include patients with Frey's syndrome of different ranges of severity and report these patients separately. Studies should investigate all possibly effective treatments (such as anticholinergics, antiperspirants and botulinum toxin) compared to control groups using different treatments or placebo. Subjective assessment of Frey's syndrome should be considered as one of the outcome measures. Plain language summary Interventions for the treatment of Frey's syndrome Background Frey's syndrome is a rare disorder, the symptoms of which include sweating and ﬂushing of the facial skin when eating, smelling, thinking or even dreaming about food. It usually happens in patients who have undergone surgery to the parotid (salivary) gland. This problem may have an impact on quality of life (for example, restricting normal activity such as eating in public). Many methods are currently used to treat Frey's syndrome, including topical application of anticholinergics and antiperspirants, and intradermal (into the skin) injections of botulinum toxin. This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of these different methods for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. Study characteristics We carried out a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in participants diagnosed with Frey's syndrome. We planned to include trials in which participants received any intervention compared to no treatment (observation) or an alternative intervention, with or without a second active treatment. Despite extensive searching, we were unable to identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. Key results There is no high‐quality evidence to establish which type of treatment is most effective for the treatment of Frey's syndrome. High‐quality clinical trials in this area should be urgently conducted. Studies should investigate all possibly effective treatments (such as anticholinergics, antiperspirants and botulinum toxin) compared to control groups using different treatments or placebo. Subjective (patient) assessment of Frey's syndrome should be one of the outcome measures used.

CD003171.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Congenital cataracts are opacities of the lens in one or both eyes of children that cause a reduction in vision severe enough to require surgery. Cataract is the largest treatable cause of visual loss in childhood. Paediatric cataracts provide different challenges to those in adults. Intense inflammation, amblyopia and posterior capsule opacification can affect results of treatment. Two treatments commonly considered for congenital cataract are lensectomy and lens aspiration. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of surgical treatments for bilateral symmetrical congenital cataracts. Success was measured according to the vision attained and occurrence of adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on  The Cochane Library,  which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register (2005, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2005), EMBASE (1980 to June 2005, week 27), LILACS (6 July 2005), the Science Citation Index and the reference list of the included studies. We also contacted trial investigators and experts in the field for details of further studies. Selection criteria We included all prospective, randomised controlled trials that compared one type of cataract surgery to another, or to no surgery, in children with bilateral congenital cataracts aged 15 years or younger. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data. No meta‐analysis was performed. Main results Four trials met the inclusion criteria. All trials were concerned with reducing the development of visual axis opacification (VAO). This was achieved with techniques that included an anterior vitrectomy or optic capture. Posterior capsulotomy alone was inadequate except in older children. Authors' conclusions Evidence exists for the care of children with congenital or developmental bilateral cataracts to reduce the occurrence of visual axis opacification. Further randomised trials are required to inform modern practice about other concerns including the timing of surgery, age for implantation of an intraocular lens and development of long‐term complications such as glaucoma and retinal detachment. Plain language summary Surgery for cataracts that develop in both eyes at or soon after birth To have a cataract describes a condition where the normally clear lens inside the eye is cloudy and obscures vision. Cataracts that develop at or soon after birth in both eyes are a major cause of childhood blindness in the world, especially in developing countries. Treatment is indicated if the cataract prevents normal vision. This can be assessed by measuring how much the child can see and looking into the eye at the cataract. The only way to correct the cataract is to surgically remove it. It is generally accepted that early surgery results in a greater chance of good vision. There are two main approaches to surgery: lensectomy and lens aspiration. Lensectomy removes the entire lens and some of the gel which fills the eye (anterior vitrectomy); lens aspiration removes the lens but leaves the posterior lens capsule intact. A significant complication from surgery is re‐clouding of the central passage for vision (visual axis opacification (VAO)). All surgical procedures aim to reduce this and the need for further treatment. Removing the cataract leaves the eye without the ability to focus. This must be corrected as soon as possible after surgery using intraocular lenses (IOL), contact lenses or spectacles, or a combination. The aim of the review was to clarify which surgical approach resulted in the best visual improvement. We searched for studies where children with cataract at or soon after birth had been randomised to receive a type of surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the level of vision after surgery. In the four included randomised studies the type of surgical procedure made no real difference to the final vision but there were differences in the number of children who developed VAO. Procedures which appeared to reduce VAO were anterior vitrectomy (removing some of the gel which fills the eye) and optic capture (lodging the lens portion of the IOL into an opening created in the posterior capsule). Three of the four studies used IOLs to correct aphakia, an option increasingly popular but which may not be suitable in regions where careful follow up cannot be guaranteed. While there is evidence for successful surgical treatment of this type of potentially blinding cataract, there is a lack of good evidence regarding aspects of its delivery such as the best timing for surgery and the appropriate method for aftercare.",Surgical interventions for bilateral congenital cataract,Long and  V; Chen and  S; Hatt and  SR,3,2,,
CD004008.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends eliminating trachomatous blindness through the SAFE strategy: Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotic treatment, Facial cleanliness and Environmental hygiene. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for trachomatous trichiasis for people living in endemic settings. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2015), the ISRCTN registry ( www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 7 May 2015. We searched the reference lists of included studies to identify further potentially relevant studies. We also contacted authors for details of other relevant studies. Selection criteria We included randomised trials of any intervention intended to treat trachomatous trichiasis. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently selected and assessed the trials, including the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for missing data when necessary. Our primary outcome was post‐operative trichiasis which was defined as any lash touching the globe at three months, one year or two years after surgery. Main results Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria with 8586 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. The majority of the studies were of a low or unclear risk of bias. Five studies compared different surgical interventions. Most surgical interventions were performed by non‐physician technicians. These trials suggest the most effective surgery is full‐thickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the terminal tarsal strip. Pooled data from two studies suggested that the bilamellar rotation was more effective than unilamellar rotation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.50). Use of a lid clamp reduced lid contour abnormalities (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98) and granuloma formation (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.97). Absorbable sutures gave comparable outcomes to silk sutures (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20) and were associated with less frequent granuloma formation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.99). Epilation was less effective at preventing eyelashes from touching the globe than surgery for mild trichiasis, but had comparable results for vision and corneal change. Peri‐operative azithromycin reduced post‐operative trichiasis; however, the estimate of effect was imprecise and compatible with no effect or increased trichiasis (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; 1954 eyes; 3 studies). Community‐based surgery when compared to health centres increased uptake with comparable outcomes. Surgery performed by ophthalmologists and integrated eye care workers was comparable. Adverse events were typically infrequent or mild and included rare postoperative infections, eyelid contour abnormalities and conjunctival granulomas. Authors' conclusions No trials were designed to evaluate whether the interventions for trichiasis prevent blindness as an outcome; however, several found modest improvement in vision following intervention. Certain interventions have been shown to be more effective at eliminating trichiasis. Full‐thickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the lash‐bearing lid margin was found to be the best technique and is preferably delivered in the community. Surgery may be carried out by an ophthalmologist or a trained ophthalmic assistant. Surgery performed with silk or absorbable sutures gave comparable results. Post‐operative azithromycin was found to improve outcomes where overall recurrence was low. Plain language summary Interventions for trachomatous trichiasis Review question  This review addressed the question: 'Which interventions improve the results of the treatment for trichiasis (in‐turned eyelashes) caused by trachoma?' Background  Trachoma is the commonest infectious cause of blindness in the world. It is caused by a bacterium called  Chlamydia trachomatis.  This infection causes inflammation and scarring of the surface of the eye, which results in the eyelid turning in (entropion) so that the eyelashes touch the eyeball. This is known as trachomatous trichiasis. The lashes can scratch the corneal surface, leading directly or indirectly (from secondary infections) to corneal opacity. Surgery to correct the eyelid deformity is the main treatment for the late stages of the disease. Most cases of trachomatous trichiasis occur in sub‐Saharan Africa. They are generally treated by nurses with limited surgical training. Unfortunately the results of the surgery can be quite variable, with frequent post‐operative trichiasis reported. Therefore, we wanted to find out what types of surgery and other interventions give the best results in treating this condition. Study characteristics  We identified 13 randomised controlled trials. They were all conducted in trachoma‐endemic countries (mostly in sub‐Saharan Africa) with surgical interventions carried out by non‐physician surgeons. Five studies compared different surgical treatments. Three studies investigated whether azithromycin antibiotic treatment after surgery improves the results. One study compared different types of sutures. One study compared surgery to the pulling out of eyelashes (epilation). One study compared the outcomes of treatments provided in the community with hospital care. One study compared the results of surgery performed by eye doctors with those of non‐specialist technicians. The evidence is current to May 2015. Most studies were funded by government research councils or charitable foundations. Key results  These trials suggested that the most effective surgery requires full‐thickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the edge of the eyelid. The use of a surgical lid clamp improves eyelid contour outcomes and reduces granuloma formation. Silk and absorbable sutures give comparable results. The addition of azithromycin treatment at the time of surgery may reduce post‐operative trichiasis under certain conditions. Epilation is less effective than surgery at treating trichiasis, but has comparable results for vision and corneal change two years after intervention. Community‐based surgery was more convenient for patients by reducing the time and expense of travelling to a conventional hospital, and it did not increase the risk of complications or recurrence. Surgery performed by ophthalmologists and by integrated eye care workers were both similarly effective. Destroying the lash roots by freezing or electrical ablation appeared to have low success rates and the equipment required is costly and can be difficult to maintain. Quality of the evidence  The quality of the evidence from these randomised controlled trials was variable. Most were of a high quality. However, several were relatively small in size and several had potential bias problems due to the method of randomisation and masking.",Interventions for trachoma trichiasis,Burton and  M; Habtamu and  E; Ho and  D; Gower and  EW,3,2,,
CD003590.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Various methods have been used to try to protect kidney function in patients undergoing surgery. These most often include pharmacological interventions such as dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,  N ‐acetyl cysteine (NAC), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin (EPO). Objectives This review is aimed at determining the effectiveness of various measures advocated to protect patients' kidneys during the perioperative period. We considered the following questions: (1) Are any specific measures known to protect kidney function during the perioperative period? (2) Of measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period, does any one method appear to be more effective than the others? (3) Of measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period,does any one method appear to be safer than the others? Search methods In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) (1966 to August 2012) and EMBASE (Ovid SP) (1988 to August 2012). We originally handsearched six journals ( Anesthesia and Analgesi a,  Anesthesiology ,  Annals of Surgery ,  British Journal of Anaesthesia, Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,  and  Journal of Vascular Surgery)  (1985 to 2004). However, because these journals are properly indexed in MEDLINE, we decided to rely on electronic searches only without handsearching the journals from 2004 onwards. Selection criteria We selected all randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing surgery for which a treatment measure was used for the purpose of providing renal protection during the perioperative period. Data collection and analysis We selected 72 studies for inclusion in this review. Two review authors extracted data from all selected studies and entered them into RevMan 5.1; then the data were appropriately analysed. We performed subgroup analyses for type of intervention, type of surgical procedure and pre‐existing renal dysfunction. We undertook sensitivity analyses for studies with high and moderately good methodological quality. Main results The updated review included data from 72 studies, comprising a total of 4378 participants. Of these, 2291 received some form of treatment and 2087 acted as controls. The interventions consisted most often of different pharmaceutical agents, such as dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, NAC, ANP, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and EPO or selected hydration fluids. Some clinical heterogeneity and varying risk of bias were noted amongst the studies, although we were able to meaningfully interpret the data. Results showed significant heterogeneity and indicated that most interventions provided no benefit. Data on perioperative mortality were reported in 41 studies and data on acute renal injury in 44 studies (all interventions combined). Because of considerable clinical heterogeneity (different clinical scenarios, as well as considerable methodological variability amongst the studies), we did not perform a meta‐analysis on the combined data. Subgroup analysis of major interventions and surgical procedures showed no significant influence of interventions on reported mortality and acute renal injury. For the subgroup of participants who had pre‐existing renal damage, the risk of mortality from 10 trials (959 participants) was estimated as odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.52; the risk of acute renal injury (as reported in the trials) was estimated from 11 trials (979 participants) as OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80. Subgroup analysis of studies that were rated as having low risk of bias revealed that 19 studies reported mortality numbers (1604 participants); OR was 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.90. Fifteen studies reported data on acute renal injury (criteria chosen by the individual studies; 1600 participants); OR was 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97. Authors' conclusions No reliable evidence from the available literature suggests that interventions during surgery can protect the kidneys from damage. However, the criteria used to diagnose acute renal damage varied in many of the older studies selected for inclusion in this review, many of which suffered from poor methodological quality such as insufficient participant numbers and poor definitions of end points such as acute renal failure and acute renal injury. Recent methods of detecting renal damage such as the use of specific biomarkers and better defined criteria for identifying renal damage (RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function and end‐stage renal failure) or AKI (acute kidney injury)) may have to be explored further to determine any possible benefit derived from interventions used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period. Plain language summary No evidence indicates that any of the measures used to protect patients' kidneys during the perioperative period are beneficial The kidneys may be damaged during an operation as a result of direct and indirect insult. The reasons for this are multiple and include changes to physiology brought on by the surgery and by the body’s response to such insult. Damage to kidneys during the perioperative period is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This updated Cochrane review looked at 72 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 4378 participants (search data until August 2012); interventions most often included pharmacological interventions (administration of dopamine and its analogues, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,  N ‐acetyl cysteine, atrial natriuretic peptide, sodium bicarbonate, antioxidants and erythropoietin) or selected hydration fluids. We attempted to identify any possible damage to the kidneys by evaluating kidney function up to seven days after the operation. No clear evidence from available RCTs suggests that any of the measures used to protect the kidneys during the perioperative period are beneficial. These findings held true in 14 studies of patients with pre‐existing renal damage and in 24 studies that were considered of good methodological quality. The primary outcomes of these studies were mortality and acute renal injury. Reported mortality in studies with low risk of bias was not different between intervention and control groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.97) or for acute renal injury (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.03). The summary of findings revealed a similar picture. So we conclude that evidence suggests that none of the interventions used currently are helpful in protecting the kidneys during the perioperative period, nor do they cause increased harm.",Interventions for protecting renal function in the perioperative period,Zacharias and  M; Mugawar and  M; Herbison and  GP; Walker and  RJ; Hovhannisyan and  K; Sivalingam and  P; Conlon and  NP,3,2,,
CD002139,"Abstract - Background The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with non‐small cell lung cancer was not clear. A systematic review and quantitative meta‐analysis was therefore undertaken to evaluate the available evidence from all relevant randomised trials. Objectives To evaluate the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on survival in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer. To investigate whether or not pre‐defined patient sub‐groups benefit more or less from chemotherapy. Search methods MEDLINE and CANCERLIT searches (1963‐june 1992) were supplemented by information from trial registers and by hand searching relevant meeting proceedings and by discussion with relevant trialists and organisations. Selection criteria Trials comparing primary treatments of surgery, surgery + radiotherapy, radical radiotherapy or supportive care versus the same primary treatment, plus chemotherapy were eligible for inclusion provided that they randomised non‐small cell lung cancer patients using a method which precluded prior knowledge of treatment assignment. Data collection and analysis A quantitative meta‐analysis using updated information from individual patients from all available randomised trials was carried out. Data from all patients randomised in all eligible trials were sought directly from those responsible. Updated information on survival, and date of last follow up were obtained, as were details of treatment allocated, date of randomisation, age, sex, histological cell type, stage and performance status. To avoid potential bias, information was requested for all randomised patients including those who had been excluded from the investigators' original analyses. All analyses were done on intention to treat on the endpoint of survival. For trials using cisplatin‐based regimens, subgroup analyses by age, sex, histological cell type, tumour stage and performance status were also done. Main results Data from 52 trials and 9387 patients were included. The results for modern regimens containing cisplatin favoured chemotherapy in all comparisons and reached conventional levels of significance when used with radical radiotherapy and with supportive care. Trials comparing surgery with surgery plus chemotherapy gave a hazard ratio of 0.87 (13% reduction in the risk of death, equivalent to an absolute benefit of 5% at 5 years). Trials comparing radical radiotherapy with radical radiotherapy plus chemotherapy gave a hazard ratio 0.87 (13% reduction in the risk of death equivalent to an absolute benefit of 4% at 2 years), and trials comparing supportive care with supportive care plus chemotherapy gave a hazard ratio of 0.73 (27% reduction in the risk of death equivalent to a 10% improvement in survival at one year). The essential drugs needed to achieve these effects were not identified. No difference in the size of effect was seen in any subgroup of patients. In all but the radical radiotherapy setting, older trials using long term alkylating agents tended to show a detrimental effect of chemotherapy. This effect reached conventional significance in the adjuvant surgical comparison. Authors' conclusions At the outset of this meta‐analysis there was considerable pessimism about the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer. These results offer hope of progress and suggest that chemotherapy may have a role in treating this disease. Plain language summary Chemotherapy can improve survival rates for non‐small cell lung cancer Non‐small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer. The standard treatment for small tumours is surgery (operation to remove the tumour) or surgery and radiotherapy (x‐ray treatment). Where the tumour has spread within the chest, standard treatment is radiotherapy. Where the tumour has spread beyond the chest supportive (treatment to relieve symptoms) is given. Trials have tried giving chemotherapy (drugs) after these standard treatments to find out whether it can help people to live longer. This review found that giving chemotherapy after either radiotherapy or supportive care did seem to help patients live longer. Giving chemotherapy after radiotherapy to 1000 patients would mean that an extra 40 patients would be expected to be alive 2 years later, than if the chemotherapy was not given. Giving chemotherapy after supportive care to 1000 patients would mean that 100 more would be expected to be alive 2 years later, than if the chemotherapy was not given. Chemotherapy after surgery may also help patients live longer although the evidence to support this is less clear.",Chemotherapy for non‐small cell lung cancer,for the Non‐Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group,2,3,,
CD006134.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Functional ovarian cysts are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age worldwide. When large, persistent, or painful, these cysts may require operations, sometimes resulting in removal of the ovary. Since early oral contraceptives were associated with a reduced incidence of functional ovarian cysts, many clinicians inferred that birth control pills could be used to treat cysts as well. This became a common clinical practice in the early 1970s. Objectives This review examined all randomized controlled trials that studied oral contraceptives as therapy for functional ovarian cysts. Search methods In March 2014, we searched the databases of CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, and POPLINE, as well as clinical trials databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP). We also examined the reference lists of articles. For the initial review, we wrote to authors of identified trials to seek articles we had missed. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials in any language that included oral contraceptives used for treatment and not prevention of functional ovarian cysts. Criteria for diagnosis of cysts were those used by authors of trials. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently abstracted data from the articles. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy of data entry. For dichotomous outcomes, we computed the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference with 95% CI. Main results We identified eight randomized controlled trials from four countries; the studies included a total of 686 women. Treatment with combined oral contraceptives did not hasten resolution of functional ovarian cysts in any trial. This held true for cysts that occurred spontaneously as well as those that developed after ovulation induction. Most cysts resolved without treatment within a few cycles; persistent cysts tended to be pathological (e.g., endometrioma or para‐ovarian cyst) and not physiological. Authors' conclusions Although widely used for treating functional ovarian cysts, combined oral contraceptives appear to be of no benefit. Watchful waiting for two or three cycles is appropriate. Should cysts persist, surgical management is often indicated. Plain language summary Oral contraceptives to treat cysts of the ovary Women of reproductive age usually release an egg about once a month. The ovary gets an egg from the inside of the ovary to its surface by creating a blister or fluid‐filled space around the developing egg. When the blister (or cyst) reaches the surface of the ovary, it bursts and releases the egg into the abdominal cavity. After this occurs, the blister can develop into another type of cyst, which makes a hormone (progesterone) that helps the pregnancy to grow. Most of these cysts come and go without problems. Sometimes, however, the cysts get large or painful; others may remain for months. Several decades ago, health care providers learned that women taking birth control pills had fewer cysts, since the pills usually kept an egg from being released. Based on this fact, many clinicians started treating these cysts with birth control pills to make them go away faster. In March 2014, we did a computer search for all randomized controlled trials that studied use of birth control pills to treat these benign (also called functional) cysts. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We found eight trials from four countries; they included 686 women. Three trials included women receiving drugs to help them get pregnant. The other five included women who developed cysts without fertility treatment. In none of these trials did oral contraceptives help the cysts go away faster. Thus, birth control pills should not be used for this purpose. A better approach is waiting two or three months for the cysts to go away on their own.",Oral contraceptives for functional ovarian cysts,Grimes and  DA; Jones and  LB; Lopez and  LM; Schulz and  KF,3,2,,
CD004299.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Cellulitis and erysipelas are now usually considered manifestations of the same condition, a skin infection associated with severe pain and systemic symptoms. A range of antibiotic treatments are suggested in guidelines. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for non‐surgically‐acquired cellulitis. Search methods In May 2010 we searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ongoing trials databases. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials comparing two or more different interventions for cellulitis. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results We included 25 studies with a total of 2488 participants. Our primary outcome 'symptoms rated by participant or medical practitioner or proportion symptom‐free' was commonly reported. No two trials examined the same drugs, therefore we grouped similar types of drugs together. Macrolides/streptogramins were found to be more effective than penicillin antibiotics (Risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). In 3 trials involving 419 people, 2 of these studies used oral macrolide against intravenous (iv) penicillin demonstrating that oral therapies can be more effective than iv therapies (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98). Three studies with a total of 88 people comparing a penicillin with a cephalosporin showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43). Six trials which included 538 people that compared different generations of cephalosporin, showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to1.06). We found only small single studies for duration of antibiotic treatment, intramuscular versus intravenous route, the addition of corticosteroid to antibiotic treatment compared with antibiotic alone, and vibration therapy, so there was insufficient evidence to form conclusions. Only two studies investigated treatments for severe cellulitis and these selected different antibiotics for their comparisons, so we cannot make firm conclusions. Authors' conclusions We cannot define the best treatment for cellulitis and most recommendations are made on single trials. There is a need for trials to evaluate the efficacy of oral antibiotics against intravenous antibiotics in the community setting as there are service implications for cost and comfort. Plain language summary Interventions for cellulitis and erysipelas This review looks at interventions for the skin infections 'cellulitis' and 'erysipelas'. These two terms are now considered different presentations of the same condition by most experts, so they are considered together for this review. For simplicity we used the one term 'cellulitis' to refer to both conditions. Cellulitis is a common painful skin infection, usually bacterial, that may require hospitalisation in severe cases. There is variation in the types of treatments prescribed, so this review aims to collate evidence on the best treatments available. The infection most commonly affects the skin of the lower leg but can infect the skin in any part of the body, usually following an injury to the skin. The symptoms include severe pain, swelling, and inflammation, often accompanied by fever, rigours, nausea, and feeling generally unwell. The infection is usually treated with antibiotics, however corticosteroids and physical treatments have been used to reduce pain, redness, and swelling, and improve the circulation to the skin. We identified 25 randomised controlled trials. No two trials investigated the same antibiotics, and there was no standard treatment regime used as a comparison. We are not able to define the best treatment for cellulitis and our limited conclusions are mostly based on single trials. No single treatment was clearly superior. Surprisingly, oral antibiotics appeared to be more effective than antibiotics given into a vein for moderate and severe cellulitis. This merits further study. Antibiotics given by injection into a muscle were as effective as when given into a vein, with a lower incidence of adverse events. In one study the addition of corticosteroids to an antibiotic appeared to shorten the length of hospital stay, however further trials are needed.

CD003412.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest cancer affecting white‐skinned individuals, and worldwide incidence is increasing. Although rarely fatal, BCC is associated with significant morbidity and costs. First‐line treatment is usually surgical excision, but alternatives are available. New published studies and the development of non‐surgical treatments meant an update of our Cochrane Review (first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2007) was timely. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for BCC in immunocompetent adults. Search methods We updated our searches of the following databases to November 2019: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for BCC in immunocompetent adults with histologically‐proven, primary BCC. Eligible comparators were placebo, active treatment, other treatments, or no treatment. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were recurrence at three years and five years (measured clinically) (we included recurrence data outside of these time points if there was no measurement at three or five years) and participant‐ and observer‐rated good/excellent cosmetic outcome. Secondary outcomes included pain during and after treatment, early treatment failure within six months, and adverse effects (AEs). We used GRADE to assess evidence certainty for each outcome. Main results We included 52 RCTs (26 new) involving 6690 participants (median 89) in this update. All studies recruited from secondary care outpatient clinics. More males than females were included. Study duration ranged from six weeks to 10 years (average 13 months). Most studies (48/52) included only low‐risk BCC (superficial (sBCC) and nodular (nBCC) histological subtypes). The majority of studies were at low or unclear risk of bias for most domains. Twenty‐two studies were industry‐funded: commercial sponsors conducted most of the studies assessing imiquimod, and just under half of the photodynamic therapy (PDT) studies. Overall, surgical interventions have the lowest recurrence rates. For high‐risk facial BCC (high‐risk histological subtype or located in the facial 'H‐zone' or both), there may be slightly fewer recurrences with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) compared to surgical excision (SE) at three years (1.9% versus 2.9%, respectively) (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 2.64; 1 study, 331 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and at five years (3.2% versus 5.2%, respectively) (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.04; 1 study, 259 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, the 95% CI also includes the possibility of increased risk of recurrence and no difference between treatments. There may be little to no difference regarding improvement of cosmetic outcomes between MMS and SE, judged by participants and observers 18 months post‐operatively (one study; low‐certainty evidence); however, no raw data were available for this outcome. When comparing imiquimod and SE for nBCC or sBCC at low‐risk sites, imiquimod probably results in more recurrences than SE at three years (16.4% versus 1.6%, respectively) (RR 10.30, 95% CI 3.22 to 32.94; 1 study, 401 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and five years (17.5% versus 2.3%, respectively) (RR 7.73, 95% CI 2.81 to 21.3; 1 study, 383 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in the number of participant‐rated good/excellent cosmetic outcomes (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; 1 study, 326 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, imiquimod may result in greater numbers of good/excellent cosmetic outcomes compared to SE when observer‐rated (60.6% versus 35.6%, respectively) (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.15; 1 study, 344 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Both cosmetic outcomes were measured at three years. Based on one study of 347 participants with high‐ and low‐risk primary BCC of the face, radiotherapy may result in more recurrences compared to SE under frozen section margin control at three years (5.2% versus 0%, respectively) (RR 19.11, 95% CI 1.12 to 325.78; low‐certainty evidence) and at four years (6.4% versus 0.6%, respectively) (RR 11.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 84.77; low‐certainty evidence). Radiotherapy probably results in a smaller number of participant‐ (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; 50.3% versus 66.1%, respectively) or observer‐rated (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.62; 28.9% versus 60.3%, respectively) good/excellent cosmetic outcomes compared to SE, when measured at four years, where dyspigmentation and telangiectasia can occur (both moderate‐certainty evidence). Methyl‐aminolevulinate (MAL)‐PDT may result in more recurrences compared to SE at three years (36.4% versus 0%, respectively) (RR 26.47, 95% CI 1.63 to 429.92; 1 study; 68 participants with low‐risk nBCC in the head and neck area; low‐certainty evidence). There were no useable data for measurement at five years. MAL‐PDT probably results in greater numbers of participant‐ (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.27; 97.3% versus 82.5%) or observer‐rated (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.26; 87.1% versus 46.6%) good/excellent cosmetic outcomes at one year compared to SE (2 studies, 309 participants with low‐risk nBCC and sBCC; moderate‐certainty evidence). Based on moderate‐certainty evidence (single low‐risk sBCC), imiquimod probably results in fewer recurrences at three years compared to MAL‐PDT (22.8% versus 51.6%, respectively) (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.62; 277 participants) and five years (28.6% versus 68.6%, respectively) (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.57; 228 participants). There is probably little to no difference in numbers of observer‐rated good/excellent cosmetic outcomes at one year (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.16; 370 participants). Participant‐rated cosmetic outcomes were not measured for this comparison. AEs with surgical interventions include wound infections, graft necrosis and post‐operative bleeding. Local AEs such as itching, weeping, pain and redness occur frequently with non‐surgical interventions. Treatment‐related AEs resulting in study modification or withdrawal occurred with imiquimod and MAL‐PDT. Authors' conclusions Surgical interventions have the lowest recurrence rates, and there may be slightly fewer recurrences with MMS over SE for high‐risk facial primary BCC (low‐certainty evidence). Non‐surgical treatments, when used for low‐risk BCC, are less effective than surgical treatments, but recurrence rates are acceptable and cosmetic outcomes are probably superior. Of the non‐surgical treatments, imiquimod has the best evidence to support its efficacy. Overall, evidence certainty was low to moderate. Priorities for future research include core outcome measures and studies with longer‐term follow‐up. Plain language summary Interventions for basal cell carcinoma of the skin Why is this question important? Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer among people with white skin. BCC is not usually life‐threatening but if left untreated, it can cause important disfigurement, especially on the face. Surgical removal of the affected area and surrounding skin is usually the first option for treating BCC. Several different surgical approaches exist as well as non‐surgical treatments, such as radiotherapy (high doses of radiation that kill cancer cells), and anti‐cancer creams, gels and ointments. We reviewed the evidence from research studies, to find out which treatments work best for BCC. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? We searched for randomised controlled studies (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We compared and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. What did we find? We found 52 studies that involved a total of 6690 adults with BCC. Most studies (48 out of 52) included hospital outpatients with small, superficial or nodular BCC. Studies lasted for between six weeks and 10 years (average duration: 13 months). Twenty‐two studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Our confidence in the evidence presented here is low to moderate, mainly because many studies were small. Comparison between different surgical treatments ‐ Mohs micrographic surgery (a specialised surgical approach that removes less skin) may slightly decrease recurrence rates at three and five years compared to surgical excision (one of the most common surgical treatments for BCC). ‐There may be little to no difference in how well scars heal between these two surgical treatments according to patients and observers (one study). Surgery versus non‐surgical treatments Compared against surgical excision: ‐ Imiquimod (an anti‐cancer cream) probably increases BCC recurrence rates at three and five years. There may be little to no difference in scar healing according to patients, although imiquimod may increase chances of scars healing well when healing is rated by an observer (one study).‐ Radiotherapy may increase BCC recurrence rates at three and four years, and probably decreases chances of scars healing well (one study).‐ MAL‐PDT, a type of photodynamic therapy (that uses a light source and light‐sensitive medicine to kill cancer cells), may increase BCC recurrence rates at three years. MAL‐PDT probably increases chances of scars healing well (two studies). Comparison of different non‐surgical treatments Compared against imiquimod: ‐ MAL‐PDT probably increases BCC recurrence rates at three and five years. There is probably little to no difference in scar healing (one study); What does this mean?

CD009076.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Fractures of the femoral shaft in children are relatively uncommon but serious injuries that disrupt the lives of children and their carers and can result in significant long‐term disability. Treatment involves either surgical fixation, such as intramedullary nailing or external fixation, or conservative treatment involving prolonged immobilisation, often in hospital. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for treating femoral shaft fractures in children and adolescents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma (BJMT) Group Specialised Register (accessed 16 August 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2013 Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August Week 1 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 week 9), CINAHL (16 August 2013), clinical trials registries, conference proceedings and reference lists; and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing conservative and surgical interventions for diaphyseal fractures of the femur in children under 18 years of age. Our primary outcomes were functional outcome measures, unacceptable malunion, and serious adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome for each comparison using the GRADE approach. We pooled data using a fixed‐effect model. Main results We included 10 trials (six randomised and four quasi‐randomised) involving a total of 527 children (531 fractures). All trials were at some risk of bias, including performance bias as care provider blinding was not practical, but to a differing extent. Just one trial was at low risk of selection bias. Reflecting both the risk of bias and the imprecision of findings, we judged the quality of evidence to be 'low' for most outcomes, meaning that we are unsure about the estimates of effect. Most trials failed to report on self‐assessed function or when children resumed their usual activities. The trials evaluated 10 different comparisons, belonging to three main categories. Surgical versus conservative treatment Four trials presenting data for 264 children aged 4 to 12 years made this comparison. Low quality evidence (one trial, 101 children) showed children had very similar function assessed using the RAND health status score at two years after surgery (external fixation) compared with conservative treatment (spica cast): mean 69 versus 68. The other three trials did not report on function. There was moderate quality evidence (four trials, 264 children, aged 4 to 12 years, followed up 3 to 24 months) that surgery reduced the risk of malunion (risk ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.59, 4 trials). Assuming an illustrative baseline risk of 115 malunions per 1000 in children treated conservatively, these data equate to 81 fewer (95% CI 47 to 97 fewer) malunions per 1000 in surgically‐treated children. Conversely, low quality evidence indicated that there were more serious adverse events such as infections after surgery (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.17, 4 trials). Assuming an illustrative baseline risk of 40 serious adverse events per 1000 for conservative treatment, these data equate to 56 more (95% CI 4 to 167 more) serious adverse events per 1000 children treated surgically. There was low quality evidence (one trial, 101 children) of similar satisfaction levels in children and parents with surgery involving external fixation and plaster cast only. However, there was low quality evidence (one trial, 46 children) that more parents were satisfied with intramedullary nailing than with traction followed by a cast, and that surgery reduced the time taken off from school. Comparisons of different methods of conservative treatment The three trials in this category made three different comparisons. We are very unsure if unacceptable malunion rates differ between immediate hip spica versus skeletal traction followed by spica in children aged 3 to 10 years followed up for six to eight weeks (RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 32.9; one trial, 42 children; very low quality evidence) .  Malunion rates at 5 to 10 years may not differ between traction followed by functional orthosis versus traction followed by spica cast in children aged 5 to 13 years (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.12; one trial, 43 children; low quality evidence). We are very unsure (very low quality evidence) if either function or serious adverse events (zero events reported) differ between single‐leg versus double‐leg spica casts (one trial, 52 young children aged two to seven years). Low quality evidence on the same comparison indicates that single‐leg casts are less awkward to manage by parents, more comfortable for the child and may require less time off work by the caregiver. Comparisons of different methods of surgical treatment The three trials in this category made three different comparisons. Very low quality evidence means that we are very unsure if the rates of malunion, serious adverse events, time to return to school or parental satisfaction actually differ in children whose fractures were fixed using elastic stable intramedullary nailing or external fixation (one trial, 19 children). The same applies to the rates of serious adverse events and time to resume full weight‐bearing in children treated with dynamic versus static external fixation (one trial, 52 children). Very low quality evidence (one trial, 47 children) means that we do not know if malunion, serious adverse events and time to resume weight‐bearing actually differ between intramedullary nailing versus submuscular plating. However, there could be more difficulties in plate removal subsequently. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to determine if long‐term function differs between surgical and conservative treatment. Surgery results in lower rates of malunion in children aged 4 to 12 years, but may increase the risk of serious adverse events. Elastic stable intramedullary nailing may reduce recovery time. There is insufficient evidence from comparisons of different methods of conservative treatment or of different methods of surgical treatment to draw conclusions on the relative effects of the treatments compared in the included trials. Plain language summary Different methods of treating fractures of the shaft of the thigh bone in children and adolescents Although uncommon, fractures of the femoral shaft (thigh bone) in children may require prolonged treatment in hospital and sometimes surgery. This can cause significant discomfort and can disrupt the lives of the children and their familles. This review compared different methods of treating these fractures. Surgical treatment comprises different methods of fixing the broken bones, such as internally‐placed nails, or pins incorporated into an external frame (external fixation). Non‐surgical or conservative treatment usually involves different types of plaster casts with or without traction (where a pulling force is applied to the leg). We searched for studies in the medical literature until August 2013. The review includes 10 randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials that recruited 527 children. Four trials compared different surgical versus non‐surgical treatments; three compared different methods of non‐surgical treatment and three compared different methods of surgical treatment. Generally we are unsure about the results of these trials because some were at risk of bias, some results were contradictory and usually there was too little evidence to rule out chance findings. Most trials failed to report on self‐assessed function or when children resumed their usual activities. Comparing surgical versus non‐surgical treatment Low quality evidence (one trial, 101 children) showed children had similar function at two years after having surgery, involving external fixation, compared with those treated with a plaster cast. The other three trials did not report this outcome. There was moderate quality evidence (four trials, 264 children, aged 4 to 12 years, followed up for 3 to 24 months) that surgery reduced the risk of malunion (the leg is deformed) compared with non‐surgical treatment. However, low quality evidence (four trials) indicated that there were more serious adverse events such as infections after surgery. There was low quality evidence (one trial, 101 children) of similar satisfaction levels in children and parents with surgery involving external fixation and plaster cast only. However, there was low quality evidence (one trial, 46 children) that more parents were satisfied with surgery involving an internal nail than with traction followed by a cast and that surgery reduced the time taken off from school. Comparing various non‐surgical treatments Very low quality evidence means that we are very unsure if the rates of malunion differ or not between children treated with immediate plaster casts versus with traction followed by plaster cast (one trial, 42 children), or between children treated with traction followed by either a functional orthosis (a brace or cast that allows some movement) or a cast (one trial, 43 children). We are very unsure if either function or serious adverse events differ between young children (aged two to seven years) immobilised in single‐leg versus double‐leg casts (one trial, 52 children). However, single‐leg casts appear to be easier to manage by parents and more comfortable for the child. Comparing various surgical treatments Very low quality evidence means that we are very unsure if the rates of malunion, serious adverse events, time to return to school or parental satisfaction actually differ in children whose fractures were fixed using internal nails or external fixation (one trial, 19 children).

CD009536.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in selected groups is now performed in England, the USA and Sweden. Patients with aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter are generally considered for elective surgical repair. Patients with aneurysm diameters below or equal to 55 mm (termed 'small AAAs') are managed with aneurysm surveillance as there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend surgery in these cases. As more patients are screened, there will be an increasing number of small AAAs identified. There is interest in pharmaceutical interventions (for example angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antibiotics, beta‐blockers, statins) which could be given to such patients to delay or reverse aneurysm expansion and reduce the need for elective surgical repair. Objectives To assess the effects of medical treatment on the expansion rate of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. Search methods The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (May 2012) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 5). Clinical trials databases were searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. The reference lists of articles retrieved by electronic searches were searched for additional citations. Selection criteria We selected randomised trials in which patients with small AAAs allocated to medical treatment with the intention of retarding aneurysm expansion were compared to patients allocated to a placebo treatment, alternative medical treatment, a different regimen of the same drug or imaging surveillance alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. Meta‐analyses were used when heterogeneity was considered low. The two primary outcomes were the mean difference (MD) in aneurysm diameter and the odds ratio (OR) calculated to compare the number of individuals referred to AAA surgery in each group over the trial period. Main results Seven trials involving 1558 participants were included in this review; 457 were involved in four trials of antibiotic medication, and 1101 were involved in three trials of beta‐blocker medication. Five of the studies were rated at a high risk of bias. Individually, all of the included trials reported non‐significant differences in AAA expansion rates between their intervention and control groups. The two major drug groups were then analysed separately. For AAA expansion it was only possible to combine two of the antibiotic trials in a meta‐analysis. This demonstrated that roxithromycin had a small but significant protective effect (MD ‐0.86 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.57 to ‐0.14). When referral to AAA surgery was compared (including all four antibiotic trials in the meta‐analysis), non‐significantly fewer patients were referred in the intervention groups (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.57) than the control groups. When only the trials reporting actual elective surgery were included in a subgroup analysis, the result remained statistically non‐significant (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.57 to 2.42). For the beta‐blocker trials, when all were combined in a meta‐analysis, there was a very small, non‐significant protective effect for propranolol on AAA expansion (MD ‐0.08 mm; 95% CI ‐0.25 to 0.10), and non‐significantly fewer patients were referred to AAA surgery in the propranolol group (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05). Bronchospasm and shortness of breath were the main adverse effects from the beta‐blockers. In one trial the adverse effects were reportedly so severe that the trial was stopped early after two years. Authors' conclusions There is some limited evidence that antibiotic medication may have a slight protective effect in retarding the expansion rates of small AAAs. The quality of the evidence makes it unclear whether this translates into fewer referrals to AAA surgery, owing mainly to the small sample sizes of the studies. Antibiotics were generally well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Propranolol was poorly tolerated by patients in all of the beta‐blocker trials and demonstrated only minimal and non‐significant protective effects. Further research on beta‐blockers for AAA needs to consider the use of drugs other than propranolol. In general, there is surprisingly little high quality evidence on medical treatment for small AAAs, especially in relation to the use of newer beta‐blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins. Plain language summary Drug treatment for small abdominal aortic aneurysms An aneurysm is an abnormal localised widening (dilatation) of an artery. The most common place for such a dilatation is the abdominal aorta. This is the main artery linking the heart to the lower limbs and the organs of the abdomen, and a dilatation here is termed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). About 4% of men over 55 years of age have an AAA, but it is less common in women. Aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter carry a high risk of rupture, and rupture carries a high risk of death. To reduce the risks, screening programmes using ultrasound scanning have been introduced for selected groups in a number of countries. Patients with aneurysms over 55 mm are then evaluated for elective aneurysm repair. For aneurysms at or below the 55 mm cut‐off, the current treatment is 'watchful waiting', where the aneurysm is repeatedly scanned over time to see if it is enlarging. This review aimed to identify medical treatments which could slow or even reverse aneurysm growth, and thus delay or avoid the need for elective surgery. We identified seven trials involving 1558 participants where the aneurysm diameters of patients randomised to receive medical treatment were compared to those participants given a control medication or surveillance imaging alone. Four trials studied the effects of antibiotics on slowing aneurysm growth, and showed a small protective effect. Three trials studied the effects of beta‐blockers, and demonstrated a very small protective effect. Notably, the beta‐blocker drugs were associated with a large number of adverse effects. It was unclear whether either drug type delayed referral to aneurysm surgery. The accuracy of the results was limited by the low number of participants (especially important when trying to detect small changes in aneurysm growth rates) and some potentially damaging biases.",Medical treatment for small abdominal aortic aneurysms,Rughani and  G; Robertson and  L; Clarke and  M,3,2,,
CD006545.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Infantile haemangiomas (previously known as strawberry birthmarks) are soft, raised swellings of the skin that occur in 3% to 10% of infants. These benign vascular tumours are usually uncomplicated and tend to regress spontaneously. However, when haemangiomas occur in high‐risk areas, such as near the eyes, throat, or nose, impairing their function, or when complications develop, intervention may be necessary. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for the management of infantile haemangiomas in children. Search methods We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, AMED, LILACS, and CINAHL. We also searched five trials registries and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of all types of interventions, versus placebo, active monitoring, or other interventions, in any child with single or multiple infantile haemangiomas (IHs) located on the skin. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were clearance, a subjective measure of improvement, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were other measures of resolution; proportion of parents or children who consider there is still a problem; aesthetic appearance; and requirement for surgical correction. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in  italics . Main results We included 28 RCTs, with a total of 1728 participants, assessing 12 different interventions, including lasers, beta blockers (e.g. propranolol, timolol maleate), radiation therapy, and steroids. Comparators included placebo, an active monitoring approach, sham radiation, and interventions given alone or in combination. Studies were conducted in a number of countries, including China, Egypt, France, and Australia. Participant age ranged from 12 weeks to 13.4 years. Most studies (23/28) included a majority of females and different types of IHs. Duration of follow‐up ranged from 7 days to 72 months. We considered most of the trials as at low risk of random sequence generation, attrition bias, and selective reporting bias. Domains such as allocation concealment and blinding were not clearly reported in general. We downgraded evidence for issues related to risk of bias and imprecision. We report results for the three most important comparisons, which we chose on the basis of current use. Outcome measurement of these comparisons was at 24 weeks' follow‐up. Oral propranolol versus placebo Compared with placebo, oral propranolol 3 mg/kg/day probably improves clinician‐assessed clearance (risk ratio (RR) 16.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.22 to 65.34; 1 study; 156 children;  moderate‐quality evidence ) and probably leads to a clinician‐assessed reduction in mean haemangioma volume of 45.9% (95% CI 11.60 to 80.20; 1 study; 40 children;  moderate‐quality evidence ). We found no evidence of a difference in terms of short‐ or long‐term serious adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.39; 3 studies; 509 children;  low‐quality evidence ), nor in terms of bronchospasm, hypoglycaemia, or serious cardiovascular adverse events. The results relating to clearance and resolution for this comparison were based on one industry‐sponsored study. Topical timolol maleate versus placebo The chance of reduction of redness, as a measure of clinician‐assessed resolution, may be improved with topical timolol maleate 0.5% gel applied twice daily when compared with placebo (RR 8.11, 95% CI 1.09 to 60.09; 1 study; 41 children; low‐quality evidence ). Regarding short‐ or long‐term serious cardiovascular events, we found no instances of bradycardia (slower than normal heart rate) or hypotension in either group (1 study; 41 children;  low‐quality evidence ). No other safety data were assessed, and clearance was not measured. Oral propranolol versus topical timolol maleate When topical timolol maleate (0.5% eye drops applied twice daily) was compared with oral propranolol (via a tablet taken once per day, at a 1.0 mg/kg dose), there was no evidence of a difference in haemangioma size (as a measure of resolution) when measured by the proportion of patients with a clinician‐assessed reduction of 50% or greater (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.97; 1 study; 26 participants;  low‐quality evidence ). Although there were more short‐ or long‐term general adverse effects (such as severe diarrhoea, lethargy, and loss of appetite) in the oral propranolol group, there was no evidence of a difference between groups (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 123.35; 1 study; 26 participants;  very low‐quality evidence ). This comparison did not measure clearance. None of our key comparisons evaluated, at any follow‐up, a subjective measure of improvement assessed by the parent or child; proportion of parents or children who consider there is still a problem; or physician‐, child‐, or parent‐assessed aesthetic appearance. Authors' conclusions We found there to be a limited evidence base for the treatment of infantile haemangiomas: a large number of interventions and outcomes have not been assessed in RCTs. Our key results indicate that in the management of IH in children, oral propranolol and topical timolol maleate are more beneficial than placebo in terms of clearance or other measures of resolution, or both, without an increase in harms. We found no evidence of a difference between oral propranolol and topical timolol maleate with regard to reducing haemangioma size, but we are uncertain if there is a difference in safety. Oral propranolol is currently the standard treatment for this condition, and our review has not found evidence to challenge this. However, these results are based on  moderate‐  to  very low‐quality evidence . The included studies were limited by small sample sizes and risk of bias in some domains. Future trials should blind personnel and participants; describe trials thoroughly in publications; and recruit a sufficient number of children to deduce meaningful results. Future trials should assess patient‐reported outcomes, as well as objective outcomes of benefit, and should report adverse events comprehensively. Propranolol and timolol maleate require further assessment in RCTs of all types of IH, including those considered problematic, as do other lesser‐used interventions and new interventions. All treatments should be compared against propranolol and timolol maleate, as beta blockers are approved as standard care. Plain language summary Treatments for haemangiomas (a cluster of small blood vessels that form a lump) of the skin in children What is the aim of this review? This Cochrane Review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of treatments for haemangiomas of the skin in infants and children (known as 'infantile haemangiomas'). We collected and analysed 28 relevant clinical trials to answer this question. Key messages Only one of our key comparisons (propranolol versus placebo) measured clearance of the haemangioma, with  moderate‐quality evidence  supporting this result. We found  low‐  or  moderate‐quality evidence  for the following specific measures of resolution: reduction in volume, redness, and size. We found  very low‐  and  low‐quality evidence  for results concerning side effects, meaning we were unable to draw definitive conclusions about safety. Oral propranolol is currently the standard treatment for this condition, and we did not find evidence to contest this treatment in terms of efficacy and safety. However, potential biases in the design of many of the included trials affect our confidence in the results of the review. High‐quality future research should assess the effects of propranolol and timolol maleate, as well as other new and older medications, on outcomes that are important to patients. What was studied in the review? Infantile haemangiomas are soft, raised swellings on the skin, often with a bright‐red surface caused by a non‐cancerous overgrowth of blood vessels in the skin. The majority of lesions are uncomplicated and will shrink on their own by age seven; however, some require treatment if they occur in high‐risk areas (e.g. near the eyes) or cause psychological distress. We included all types of treatment for infantile haemangiomas, which could have been given alone or in combination, or compared to each other, to a 'placebo' (i.e. a treatment with no active agent), or against children whose haemangiomas were untreated but observed. What are the main results of the review? We included 28 studies, with a total of 1728 participants, which assessed lasers, beta blockers (e.g. propranolol), steroids, radiation therapy, and other treatments. Treatments were compared against an active monitoring approach (observation), placebo, sham radiation, or other interventions (given alone or in combination with another treatment). Studies were conducted in multiple countries; participant age ranged from 12 weeks to 13.4 years; and most studies included more girls than boys (23/28). Children had different types of haemangioma. Duration of follow‐up ranged from 7 days to 72 months. The following results were measured 24 weeks after the beginning of treatment. All non‐safety outcomes presented here were clinician assessed (i.e. assessed by the physician in charge of a patient). When compared with placebo treatment, propranolol taken by mouth at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day is probably more beneficial in terms of complete or almost‐complete clearance of swelling and reduction in volume of the haemangioma ( moderate‐quality evidence ). We found no evidence of a difference between the two treatments in terms of short‐ or long‐term serious or other side effects ( low‐quality evidence ).

CD007112.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Hyperopia, or hypermetropia (also known as long‐sightedness or far‐sightedness), is the condition where the unaccommodating eye brings parallel light to a focus behind the retina instead of on it. Hyperopia can be corrected with both non‐surgical and surgical methods, among them photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser assisted In situ keratomileusis (LASIK). There is uncertainty as to whether hyperopic‐PRK or hyperopic‐LASIK is the better method. Objectives The objectives of this review were to determine whether PRK or LASIK leads to more reliable, stable and safe results when correcting a hyperopic refractive error. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to February 2012), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 17 February 2012. When trials are included in the review we will search the reference lists of the studies included in the review for information about further trials. We will use the Science Citation Index to search for papers that cite any studies included in this review. We did not handsearch journals or conference proceedings specifically for this review. Selection criteria We planned to include only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PRK against LASIK for correction of hyperopia and then perform a sensitivity analysis of pre‐ and post‐millennial trials since this is the mid‐point in the history of both PRK and LASIK. Data collection and analysis We did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Main results As no studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, we discussed the results of non‐randomised trials comparing hyperopic‐PRK with hyperopic‐LASIK. Authors' conclusions No robust, reliable conclusions could be reached, but the non‐randomised trials reviewed appear to be in agreement that hyperopic‐PRK and hyperopic‐LASIK are of comparable efficacy. High quality, well‐planned open RCTs are needed in order to obtain a robust clinical evidence base. Plain language summary Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) versus laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for correction of long‐sightedness Hyperopia (long‐sightedness or far‐sightedness) is the condition where the relaxed eye brings parallel light to a focus behind the retina instead of on it. In order to correct hyperopia a variety of surgical techniques can be applied including PRK and LASIK. There exists an uncertainty as to which technique provides more accurate, stable and safe results. As no randomised controlled trials were found that met the inclusion criteria, we could not find definite answers to these questions and therefore concluded that more research is required.",Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) versus laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for hyperopia correction,Settas and  G; Settas and  C; Minos and  E; Yeung and  IYL,2,3,,
CD006246.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Ovarian carcinosarcoma, also known as malignant mixed Mullerian tumour, is a rare malignant gynaecological tumour constituting about 1% or less of all ovarian cancers. In over 80% of cases, there is extra‐ovarian intra‐abdominal spread at diagnosis. The primary treatment has traditionally been surgical cytoreduction followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Regimes have included cisplatin alone; a combination of doxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine, cyclophosphamide, taxol; and various other combinations. The effectiveness of these various regimens appears to be mixed. Therefore, there is a need to clarify if there is an optimum neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy after surgical cytoreduction for this rare tumour. Also, it is important to address quality of life (QoL) issues related to treatment, particularly toxicity, as the overall prognosis appears to be poor. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of various adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy options or chemotherapy alone in combination with surgery in the management of ovarian carcinosarcoma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to February 2012. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of review articles and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or chemotherapy alone, in women with ovarian carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian sarcoma of the ovary). We also reviewed non‐randomised studies (NRS) for discussion in the absence of RCTs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. No trials were found and therefore no data were analysed. Main results The search strategy identified 297 unique references of which all were excluded. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence to inform decisions about neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens, or chemotherapy alone, for women with ovarian carcinosarcoma .  Ideally, an RCT that is multicentre or multinational, or well designed non‐randomised studies that use multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline imbalances, are needed to compare treatment modalities and improve current knowledge. Further research in genetic and molecular signalling pathways might improve understanding of this tumour subtype. Plain language summary Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both after surgery for treatment of a rare tumour of the ovary Ovarian carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumour) is a rare malignant gynaecological tumour comprising around 1% or less of all ovarian cancers. These tumours contain both carcinomatous (arising from the epithelial tissue, the tissue that lines the cavities and surfaces of structures throughout the body) and sarcomatous tissue (arising from the connective tissue) within them. This tumour usually presents at an advanced stage and has a poor survival rate despite treatment. It is usually treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy. Various types of chemotherapy drugs have been used to treat the woman before and after surgery (neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings). There is currently no evidence to determine whether any form of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, in combination with surgery is better or worse for prolonging survival and improving quality of life or toxicity. The review highlights the need for good quality studies comparing various chemotherapy regimens, both pre‐ and post‐surgery, with or without radiotherapy. Multicentre, multinational and collaborative good quality studies are needed to investigate this rare disease.",Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in combination with surgery for ovarian carcinosarcoma,Shylasree and  TS; Bryant and  A; Athavale and  R,3,2,,
CD000434.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Fracture of the proximal humerus, often termed shoulder fracture, is a common injury in older people. The management of these fractures varies widely. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2012. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of treatment and rehabilitation interventions for proximal humeral fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases, conference proceedings and bibliographies of trial reports. The full search ended in November 2014. Selection criteria We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials pertinent to the management of proximal humeral fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis Both review authors performed independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Only limited meta‐analysis was performed. Main results We included 31 heterogeneous RCTs (1941 participants). Most of the 18 separate treatment comparisons were tested by small single‐centre trials. The main exception was the surgical versus non‐surgical treatment comparison tested by eight trials. Except for a large multicentre trial, bias in these trials could not be ruled out. The quality of the evidence was either low or very low for all comparisons except the largest comparison. Nine trials evaluated non‐surgical treatment in mainly minimally displaced fractures. Four trials compared early (usually one week) versus delayed (three or four weeks) mobilisation after fracture but only limited pooling was possible and most of the data were from one trial (86 participants). This found some evidence that early mobilisation resulted in better recovery and less pain in people with mainly minimally displaced fractures. There was evidence of little difference between the two groups in shoulder complications (2/127 early mobilisation versus 3/132 delayed mobilisation; 4 trials) and fracture displacement and non‐union (2/52 versus 1/54; 2 trials). One quasi‐randomised trial (28 participants) found the Gilchrist‐type sling was generally more comfortable than the Desault‐type sling (body bandage). One trial (48 participants) testing pulsed electromagnetic high‐frequency energy provided no evidence. Two trials (62 participants) provided evidence indicating little difference in outcome between instruction for home exercises versus supervised physiotherapy. One trial (48 participants) reported, without presentable data, that home exercise alone gave better early and comparable long‐term results than supervised exercise in a swimming pool plus home exercise. Eight trials, involving 567 older participants, evaluated surgical intervention for displaced fractures. There was high quality evidence of no clinically important difference in patient‐reported shoulder and upper‐limb function at one‐ or two‐year follow‐up between surgical (primarily locking plate fixation or hemiarthroplasty) and non‐surgical treatment (sling immobilisation) for the majority of displaced proximal humeral fractures; and moderate quality evidence of no clinically important difference between the two groups in quality of life at two years (and at interim follow‐ups at six and 12 months). There was moderate quality evidence of little difference between groups in mortality in the surgery group (17/248 versus 12/248; risk ratio (RR) 1.40 favouring non‐surgical treatment, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 2.83; P = 0.35; 6 trials); only one death was explicitly linked with the treatment. There was moderate quality evidence of a higher risk of additional surgery in the surgery group (34/262 versus 16/261; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.60; P = 0.01; 7 trials). Although there was moderate evidence of a higher risk of adverse events after surgery, the 95% confidence intervals for adverse events also included the potential for a greater risk of adverse events after non‐surgical treatment. Different methods of surgical management were tested in 12 trials. One trial (57 participants) comparing two types of locking plate versus a locking nail for treating two‐part surgical neck fractures found some evidence of slightly better function after plate fixation but also of a higher rate of surgically‐related complications. One trial (61 participants) comparing a locking plate versus minimally invasive fixation with distally inserted intramedullary K‐wires found little difference between the two implants at two years. Compared with hemiarthroplasty, one trial (32 participants) found similar results with locking plate fixation in function and re‐operation rates, whereas another trial (30 participants) reported all five re‐operations occurred in the tension‐band fixation group. One trial (62 participants) found better patient‐rated (Quick DASH) and composite shoulder function scores at a minimum of two years follow‐up and a lower incidence of re‐operation and complications after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) compared with hemiarthroplasty. No important between‐group differences were found in one trial (120 participants) comparing the deltoid‐split approach versus deltopectoral approach for non‐contact bridging plate fixation, and two trials (180 participants) comparing 'polyaxial' and 'monaxial' screws in locking plate fixation. One trial (68 participants) produced some preliminary evidence that tended to support the use of medial support locking screws in locking plate fixation. One trial (54 participants) found fewer adverse events, including re‐operations, for the newer of two types of intramedullary nail. One trial (35 participants) found better functional results for one of two types of hemiarthroplasty. One trial (45 participants) found no important effects of tenodesis of the long head of the biceps for people undergoing hemiarthroplasty. Very limited evidence suggested similar outcomes from early versus later mobilisation after either surgical fixation (one trial: 64 participants) or hemiarthroplasty (one trial: 49 participants). Authors' conclusions There is high or moderate quality evidence that, compared with non‐surgical treatment, surgery does not result in a better outcome at one and two years after injury for people with displaced proximal humeral fractures involving the humeral neck and is likely to result in a greater need for subsequent surgery. The evidence does not cover the treatment of two‐part tuberosity fractures, fractures in young people, high energy trauma, nor the less common fractures such as fracture dislocations and head splitting fractures. There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to inform the choices between different non‐surgical, surgical, or rehabilitation interventions for these fractures. Plain language summary Interventions for treating shoulder fractures in adults Background Fracture of the top end of the upper arm bone (proximal humerus) is a common injury in older people. It is often called a shoulder fracture. The bone typically fractures (breaks) just below the shoulder, usually after a fall. Most of these fractures occur without breaking the skin lying over the fracture. The injured arm is often supported in a sling until the fracture heals sufficiently to allow shoulder movement. More severe (displaced) fractures may be treated surgically. This may involve fixing the fracture fragments together by various means. Alternatively, the top of the fractured bone may be replaced (half 'shoulder' replacement: hemiarthroplasty). More rarely, the whole joint, thus including the joint socket, is replaced (total 'shoulder' replacement). Physiotherapy is often used to help restore function. Results of the search We searched medical databases up to November 2014 and included 31 randomised studies with a total of 1941 participants. Most of the 18 treatment comparisons were tested by one study only. The best evidence was from eight studies, one of which was a relatively large multicentre study; these investigated whether surgery gave a better result than non‐surgical treatment for displaced fractures. Key results Nine trials evaluated non‐surgical treatment in usually less severe fractures. One trial found a type of arm sling was generally more comfortable than a type of body bandage. There was some evidence that early mobilisation (within one week), compared with delayed mobilisation (after three weeks), resulted in less pain and faster recovery in people with 'stable' fractures. Two studies provided weak evidence that many patients could generally achieve a satisfactory outcome when given sufficient instruction to pursue exercises on their own. Eight studies, involving 567 participants with displaced fractures, compared surgical versus non‐surgical treatment. Pooled results from the five most recent trials showed that there were no important differences between the two approaches for patient‐reported measures of function and quality of life at 6, 12 and 24 months. There was little difference between the two groups in mortality. Twice as many surgical group patients had additional or secondary surgery. More surgical group patients had adverse events. Twelve trials (744 participants) tested different methods of surgical treatment. There was weak evidence of some differences (e.g. in complications) between some interventions (e.g. different devices or different ways of using devices). There was very limited evidence suggesting similar outcomes for early versus delayed mobilisation after either surgical fixation or hemiarthroplasty. Quality of the evidence Most of the 31 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered that the evidence was either of high or moderate quality for the results of the surgical versus non‐surgical treatment comparison, which means that we are pretty certain",Interventions for treating proximal humeral fractures in adults,Handoll and  HHG; Brorson and  S,3,3,,
CD003278.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Winging of the scapula is caused by weakness of the thoracoscapular muscles, which allows the scapula to lift off the chest wall during shoulder movements. In facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (and occasionally in other muscular dystrophies) there is selective weakness of the thoracoscapular muscles which may spare other shoulder muscles such as the deltoid muscle. This imbalance results in significant winging and loss of shoulder function. Historically, a number of different surgical and non‐surgical interventions have been used to achieve scapular stability. This review examines the evidence available for the use of all scapular fixation techniques in muscular dystrophy, especially facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Objectives To examine the evidence for the relative efficacy of scapular fixation techniques in muscular dystrophy (especially facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy) in improving upper limb function. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (20 July 2009), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2009) Medline (1966 to July 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to July 2009) for randomised trials. We also contacted authors of trials and other experts in the field. Selection criteria All reports of scapular fixation for muscular dystrophy, including quasi‐randomised or randomised controlled trials, comparing any form of scapular fixation (surgical and non‐surgical) in people (of all ages and of all severity) with scapular winging due to muscular dystrophy. Our primary outcome measure was objective improvement in shoulder abduction. Our secondary outcome measures were: patient‐perceived improvement in performance of activities of daily living, cosmetic results, subjective improvement in pain and proportion of patients with significant postoperative complications. Data collection and analysis We collated and summarised studies on the treatment of scapular winging in muscular dystrophy. Main results No randomised trials were identified. We therefore present a review of the non‐randomised literature available. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the suggestion from observational studies that operative interventions produce significant benefits. However, these have to be balanced against postoperative immobilisation, need for physiotherapy and potential complications. We conclude that a randomised trial would be difficult, but a register of cases and the use of a standardised assessment protocol would allow more accurate comparison of the disparate techniques. Plain language summary Surgical operations for winging of the shoulder blade in muscular dystrophy Winging of the scapula (shoulder blade) in muscular dystrophy is caused by weakness of the muscles which attach the scapula to the chest and help raise the arms. Non‐surgical interventions involve casts or slings to support the shoulders. Surgical operations involve fixing the scapulae to the ribs using screws or wire. No randomised controlled trials were found. Small case series suggest that surgical operations might produce significant benefits in some people. These need to be balanced against loss of mobility, need for physiotherapy and possible complications including failure of the fixing material or reduced breathing capacity.",Scapular fixation in muscular dystrophy,Orrell and  RW; Copeland and  S; Rose and  MR,3,3,,
CD012302.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal dilatation of the infradiaphragmatic aorta that is equal to or greater than 30 mm or a local dilatation of equal to or greater than 50% compared to the expected normal diameter of the artery. AAAs rarely occur in individuals under 50 years of age, but thereafter the prevalence dramatically increases with age, with men at a six‐fold greater risk of developing an AAA than women. Prevalence of AAA has been reported to range from 1.3% in women aged 65 to 80 years to between 4% and 7.7% in men aged 65 to 80 years. There is evidence that the risk of rupture increases as the aneurysm diameter increases from 50 mm to 60 mm. People with AAAs over 55 mm in diameter are therefore generally referred for consideration of repair, as the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair. The traditional treatment for AAA is open surgical repair (OSR) which involves a large abdominal incision and is associated with a significant risk of complications. Two less invasive procedures have recently become more widely used:  e ndo v ascular  a neurysm  r epair (EVAR) and laparoscopic repair. EVAR is carried out through sheaths inserted in the femoral artery in the groin: thereafter, a stent graft is placed within the aneurysm sac under radiological image guidance and anchored in place to form a new channel for blood flow. Laparoscopic repair involves the use of a laparoscope which is inserted through small cuts in the abdomen and the synthetic graft is sewn in place to replace the weakened area of the aorta. Laparoscopic AAA repair falls into two categories: hand‐assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS), where an incision is made to allow the surgeon's hand to assist in the repair; and total laparoscopic surgery (TLS). Both EVAR and laparoscopic repair are favourable over OSR as they are minimally invasive, less painful, associated with fewer complications and lower mortality rate and have a shorter duration of hospital stay. Current evidence suggests that elective laparoscopic AAA repair has a favourable safety profile comparable with that of EVAR, with low conversion rates as well as similar mortality and morbidity rates. As a result, it has been suggested that elective laparoscopic AAA repair may have a role in treating those patients for whom EVAR is unsuitable. Objectives To assess the effects of laparoscopic surgery for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The primary objective of this review was to assess the perioperative mortality and operative time of laparoscopic (total and hand‐assisted) surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) compared to traditional open surgical repair or EVAR. The secondary objective was to assess complication rates, all‐cause mortality (> 30 days), hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, conversion and re‐intervention rates, and quality of life associated with laparoscopic (total and hand‐assisted) surgical repair compared to traditional open surgical repair or EVAR. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2016) and CENTRAL (2016, Issue 7). In addition the CIS searched trials registries for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by electronic searches for additional citations. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials in which patients with an AAA underwent elective laparoscopic repair (total laparoscopic repair or hand‐assisted laparoscopic repair) compared with either open surgical repair or EVAR. Data collection and analysis Studies identified for potential inclusion were independently assessed for inclusion by at least two review authors. Main results One randomised controlled trial with a total of 100 male participants was included in the review. The trial compared hand‐assisted laparoscopic repair with EVAR and provided results for in‐hospital mortality, operative time, length of hospital stay and lower limb ischaemia. The included study did not report on the other pre‐planned outcomes of this review. No in‐hospital deaths occurred in the study. Hand‐associated laparoscopic repair was associated with a longer operative time (MD 53.00 minutes, 95% CI 36.49 to 69.51) than EVAR. The incidence of lower limb ischaemia was similar between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 5.34). The mean length of hospital stay was 4.2 days and 3.4 days in the hand‐assisted laparoscopic repair and EVAR groups respectively but standard deviations were not reported and therefore it was not possible to independently test the statistical significance of this result. The quality of evidence was downgraded for imprecision due to the inclusion of one small study; and wide confidence intervals and indirectness due to the study including male participants only. No study compared laparoscopic repair (total or hand‐assisted) with open surgical repair or total laparoscopic surgical repair with EVAR. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic (total and hand‐assisted) surgical repair of AAA versus open surgical repair or EVAR, because only one small randomised trial was eligible for inclusion in this review. High‐quality randomised controlled trials are needed. Plain language summary Laparoscopic surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm Background An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal widening of the abdominal aorta, the main artery supplying blood to the organs in the abdomen and lower part of the body. Between 4% and 7% of men over 65 years of age have an AAA, but it is less common in women. Aneurysms over 55 mm in diameter carry a high risk of rupture which can lead to death; approximately 60% of people with a ruptured AAA die before reaching hospital. People with AAAs over 55 mm are generally referred for repair, as the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair. There are three methods of repairing an AAA: surgery, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and laparoscopic repair. Surgery involves making a large cut in the abdomen, after which the abdominal aorta is exposed and opened and a synthetic graft (tube) is sewn in place to replace the weakened area of the aorta. EVAR involves making a cut in the groin area, after which a stent graft is inserted in collapsed form and opened inside the aneurysm under x‐ray guidance and held in place with a stent. Laparoscopic repair or 'keyhole' AAA surgery is carried out by making very small cuts in the patient’s abdomen, after which a fine telescope (a laparoscope) is inserted through these cuts and the synthetic graft is sewn in place. The benefits of EVAR and laparoscopic repair are that they require smaller incisions, are less painful, have fewer complications, a lower mortality rate and shorter hospital stay than surgical repair. Current evidence suggests that EVAR is the preferred approach for AAA repair. However laparoscopic AAA repair has been suggested as a safe and effective alternative in treating those patients for whom EVAR is unsuitable. This review aimed to assess the effects of laparoscopic surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Study characteristics and key results One randomised controlled trial (current until August 2016), studying 100 male participants and comparing hand‐assisted laparoscopic repair with EVAR, was included in this review. No in‐hospital deaths occurred during the study. The trial showed that hand‐assisted laparoscopic repair took longer to perform than EVAR but there was no difference in the number of patients with reduced blood flow to the leg following either treatment. Quality of evidence At present, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials examining the comparative effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic repair of AAA. The quality of the available evidence was imprecise due to the inclusion of one small study and wide confidence intervals; and indirect because the study includes male participants only. Conclusions Further research is required before conclusions can be made.",Laparoscopic surgery for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,Robertson and  L; Nandhra and  S,3,2,,
CD010233.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition and maintenance of remission is a major issue as many patients fail to achieve remission with medical management and require surgical interventions. Purine analogues such as azathioprine (AZA) and 6‐mercaptopurine (6‐MP) have been used to maintain surgically‐induced remission in CD, but the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of these agents remains controversial. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of purine analogues (AZA and 6‐MP) for maintenance of surgically‐induced remission in CD. Search methods We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 26 July 2018 (and from inception to 31 July 2019). In addition, we searched reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews, conference proceedings and trials registers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of at least three months that enrolled adults and children with surgically‐induced remission of CD and compared AZA or 6‐MP to no treatment, placebo or any other active intervention were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The primary outcome was clinical relapse. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic relapse, radiologic and surgical relapse, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawal due to AEs and health‐related quality of life. Main results Ten RCTs with a total of 928 participants were included. Study participants were adults recruited from university clinics and gastroenterology hospitals who received interventions post‐surgery for a duration between 12 to 36 months. Most study participants were recruited less than three months after surgery in all except one study where participants were recruited between 6 to 24 months post‐surgery. One study was rated as low risk of bias, six studies were rated high risk of bias and three were rated unclear risk of bias. There was moderate certainty evidence that purine analogues are more efficient for preventing clinical relapse than placebo. At 12 to 36 months, 51% (109/215) of AZA/6‐MP participants relapsed compared to 64% (124/193) of placebo participants (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92; 408 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence regarding the efficacy of AZA or 6‐MP for maintaining postoperative clinical remission compared to 5‐ASA compounds was low. At 12 to 24 months , 64% (113/177) of purine analogue participants relapsed compared to 59% (101/170) of 5‐ASA participants (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.24; 347 participants; 4 studies; I² = 8%; low certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence that purine analogues are inferior for preventing postsurgical clinical relapse compared to tumour necrosis factor alpha agents (anti‐TNF‐α) was very low. At 12 to 24 months, 43% (29/67) of AZA participants relapsed compared to 14% (10/72) of anti‐TNF‐α participants (RR 2.89; 95% CI 1.50 to 5.57; 139 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence). The effect of purine analogues compounds on AEs compared to placebo or any active treatment was uncertain, as the quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. After 12 to 24 months, 14% (12/87) of purine analogue participants experienced an AE compared to 10% (8/81) of placebo participants (RR 1.36; 95% CI 0.57 to 3.27; 168 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). The effect of purine analogues on AEs compared to 5‐ASA agents was uncertain. After 12 to 24 months, 41% (73/176) of purine analogue participants had an AE compared to 47% (81/171) of 5‐ASA participants (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.07; 346 participants; 4 studies; I² = 15%; low certainty evidence). The effect of purine analogues on AEs in comparison to anti TNF‐α agents was uncertain. At 12 to 24 months, 57% (32/56) of AZA participants had an AE compared to 51% (31/61) of anti‐TNF‐α participants (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53; 117 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Purine analogue participants were more like than 5‐ASA participants to have a SAE (RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.13, 311 participants; 3 studies; I² = 9%; very low certainty evidence), or to withdraw due to an AE (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.81; 425 participants; 5 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Commonly reported AEs across all studies included leucopenia, arthralgia, abdominal pain or severe epigastric intolerance, elevated liver enzymes, nausea and vomiting, pancreatitis, anaemia, nasopharyngitis and flatulence. Authors' conclusions Moderate certainty evidence suggests that AZA and 6‐MP may be superior to placebo for maintenance of surgically‐induced remission in participants with CD. There was no clear difference in the number of clinical relapses when purine analogues were compared with 5‐ASA agents, however this is based on low certainty evidence. There was very low certainty evidence that AZA and 6‐MP are more likely to result in more serious adverse events (SAEs) and withdrawals due to an AE (low certainty) when compared to 5‐ASA agents. Very low certainty evidence suggests that purine analogues may be inferior to anti‐TNF‐α agents, however, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Further research investigating the efficacy and safety of AZA and 6‐MP in comparison to other active medications in surgically‐induced remission of CD is warranted. Plain language summary Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine for the maintenance of surgically‐induced remission in Crohn’s disease What was the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to understand the benefits and harms of purine analogues (azathioprine (AZA) and 6‐mercaptopurine (6‐MP)) used for maintaining remission following surgery in people with Crohn's disease (CD). What is Crohn's disease? Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. The disease is known to constantly change from periods when sufferers have symptoms (relapse) to periods when the symptoms disappear (remission) for a short time. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut. However, their symptoms can return after a short time. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease are free from symptoms for as long as possible. However, there are concerns about possible side effects that may arise. Purine analogues (AZA and 6‐MP) are a group of immunosuppressive drugs which have been used for over five decades to manage Crohn's disease. We researched whether purine antimetabolites can maintain remission in people with Crohn's disease after the diseased portion of their gut has been removed. What are the main results of the review? The review authors found 10 relevant studies with a total of 928 participants, conducted across several European countries, Israel and the US. The studies included people with Crohn's disease over 16 years of age who had undergone surgery and were free from symptoms. These studies compared purine analogues with placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), or oral 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) formulations or with anti‐tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (anti‐TNF‐α) drugs. 5‐ASA and anti‐TNF‐ɑ drugs are used reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut. One study was high quality, while six studies were of lower quality and three studies did not report enough information to make a judgement on quality. Purine analogues are probably better than placebo for maintaining surgically‐induced remission of Crohn's disease (moderate certainty evidence). The analysis of studies that compared purine antimetabolites to 5‐ASA medications found no difference in the number of people who remained in remission. However, more people who received purine analogues experienced serious side effects or discontinued treatment due to side effects than those who received 5‐ASA (very low and low certainty evidence). The analysis of studies that compared purine analogues to anti‐TNF‐α drugs showed that purine analogues were less effective for maintaining remission of Crohn's disease after surgery. However, the overall certainty of evidence was very low. Well designed studies are needed to better understand the benefits and harms of purine analogues compared with anti‐TNF‐ɑ agents and other active drugs used for Crohn's disease. Due to sparse data and inconsistent reporting across all studies, the effect of purine analogues on side effects compared with placebo, 5‐ASA or biologics was uncertain. Commonly reported side effects across the studies included leucopenia (a reduction in the number of white cells in the blood), pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas), arthralgia (joint pain), abdominal pain or severe epigastric intolerance, elevated liver enzymes, nausea and vomiting, anaemia (low number of red blood cells), nasopharyngitis (common cold) and flatulence (intestinal gas). How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 31 July 2019. Conclusions There is moderate certainty evidence that AZA and 6‐MP may be superior to placebo for maintenance of surgically‐induced remission in participants with Crohn's disease. There was no clear difference in the number of clinical relapses when purine analogues were compared with 5‐ASA agents, however this was based on low certainty evidence. There was very low certainty evidence that AZA and 6‐MP are more likely to result in more serious side effects and withdrawals due to side effects when compared to 5‐ASA agents. Very low certainty evidence suggests that purine analogues may be inferior to anti‐TNF‐α agents for preventing relapse, however, no firm conclusions can be drawn.

CD008717.PUB3,"Abstract - Background The liver is affected by two of the most common groups of malignant tumours: primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma or other extrahepatic primary cancers. Liver metastases are significantly more common than primary liver cancer, and the reported long‐term survival rate after radical surgical treatment is approximately 50%. However, R0 resection (resection for cure) is not feasible in the majority of patients; therefore, other treatments have to be considered. One of these is percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), which causes dehydration and necrosis of tumour cells, accompanied by small‐vessel thrombosis, leading to tumour ischaemia and destruction of the tumour. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in people with liver metastases. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 10 September 2019: the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; Science Citation Index Expanded; Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We also searched clinical trials registers such as ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (17 September 2019) . Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection and its comparators (no intervention, other ablation methods, systemic treatments) for liver metastases. Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures as outlined by Cochrane. We extracted information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, study design, and trial methods. Two review authors performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using GRADE. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Main results We identified only one randomised clinical trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection (PEI) in addition to transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) versus TACE alone. The trial was conducted in China and included 48 trial participants with liver metastases: 25 received PEI plus TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. The trial included 37 male and 11 female participants. Mean participant age was 49.3 years. Sites of primary tumours included colon (27 cases), stomach (12 cases), pancreas (3 cases), lung (3 cases), breast (2 cases), and ovary (1 case). Seven participants had a single tumour, 15 had two tumours, and 26 had three or more tumours in the liver. The bulk diameter of the tumour on average was 3.9 cm, ranging from 1.2 cm to 7.6 cm. Participants were followed for 10 months to 43 months. The trial reported survival data after one, two, and three years. In the PEI + TACE group, 92%, 80%, and 64% of participants survived after one year, two years, and three years; in the TACE alone group, these percentages were 78.3%, 65.2%, and 47.8%, respectively. Upon conversion of these data to mortality rates, the calculated risk ratio (RR) for mortality at last follow‐up when PEI plus TACE was compared with TACE alone was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.33; very low‐certainty evidence) after three years of follow‐up. Local recurrence was 16% in the PEI plus TACE group and 39.1% in the TACE group, resulting in an RR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.15; very low‐certainty evidence). Forty‐five out of a total of 68 tumours (66.2%) shrunk by at least 25% in the PEI plus TACE group versus 31 out of a total of 64 tumours (48.4%) in the TACE group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but provided very few details. We did not find data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‐related quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. The single included trial did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effectiveness of PEI plus TACE versus TACE in people with liver metastases is of very low certainty and is based on one small randomised clinical trial at high risk of bias. Currently, it cannot be determined whether adding PEI to TACE makes a difference in comparison to using TACE alone. Evidence for benefits or harms of PEI compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments is lacking. Plain language summary Percutaneous ethanol injection for liver metastases Is local destruction of the cancer that spread to the liver with percutaneous ethanol injection beneficial? Review question What is the effect of using percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) to destroy any cancer metastases in the liver? Metastases are new cancer sites that are found in parts of the body other than the site of the original cancer. We were looking for any randomised trial (a study in which patients are allocated to groups by a play of chance) assessing effects of PEI in people with metastases in the liver from cancer of any location compared with no PEI with or without co‐interventions. We looked at effects of PEI on risk of death, progression of disease, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events (unwanted effects caused by the intervention). Background When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites of metastasis is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancers affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die of complications. Metastases in the liver can be destroyed by several different methods, one of them being PEI. This procedure is performed under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance; a special needle is placed at the cancer site and is subsequently used to inject alcohol with the goal of killing cancer tissues. Ultrasound and computed tomography are imaging procedures. Alcohol induces tumour destruction by drawing water out of tumour cells (dehydrating them), thereby altering (denaturing) the structure of the cellular proteins. Search results and study characteristics We last searched for evidence on 10 September 2019. We included only one randomised trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE; a liver‐directed treatment whereby chemotherapy is administered through the catheter directly to blood vessels supplying the tumour) to TACE alone. Forty‐eight people with liver metastases were included; 25 received PEI with TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. Primary tumours were colon, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, and ovary cancers. The included study did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Key results Results of one small randomised clinical trial do not show beneficial or harmful effects of adding percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection to TACE in people with liver metastases with respect to mortality or local recurrence in comparison with TACE alone. Participants were followed for between 10 and 43 months. The tumour necrosis was larger in the combined treatment group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but gave very few details. We found no data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‐related quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. Quality of evidence We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty because the identified study was at high risk of bias, had a relatively small sample size, described few events overall, and reported inconclusive results.",Percutaneous ethanol injection for liver metastases,Swierz and  MJ; Storman and  D; Riemsma and  RP; Wolff and  R; Mitus and  JW; Pedziwiatr and  M; Kleijnen and  J; Bala and  MM,3,2,,
CD004547.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Cholelithiasis is a common disease of the biliary tract. Chinese medicinal herbs are being used widely as an alternative treatment in people with cholelithiasis, but their beneficial or harmful effects have not been assessed systematically. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of Chinese medicinal herbs in people with cholelithiasis. Search methods We conducted searches in the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, Chinese Medicine Conference Disc, and Chinese Bio‐Medicine Disc to January 2013. We handsearched four Chinese journals. No language or year of publication restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials studying Chinese medicinal herbs for treatment of cholelithiasis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (SJ, TG) independently extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated the risk ratio (RR), and for continuous data, we calculated the mean difference. We also calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Eleven randomised trials with 1205 participants with asymptomatic or mild‐to‐moderate cholelithiasis were included. None of the randomised clinical trials compared a single Chinese medicinal herb with a Western medicine or with surgery. No placebo‐controlled trials were identified. In the trials comparing one Chinese herbal medicine (Gandanxiaoshi tablet) versus another (Aihuodantong tablet), there was no significant difference in the improvement of upper abdominal pain after the end of treatment (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.05), and the heterogeneity among trials was not substantial. No other outcomes could be assessed. The remaining trials of Chinese medicinal herbs (Qingdan capsule, Danshu capsule, Paishi capsule, Rongdanpaishi capsule), did not offer specific data on symptoms, signs, or change in gallstones that would permit assessment of significant differences in curative effects between the treatment and control groups. No serious adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions This review reveals no strong evidence that the analysed Chinese medicinal herbs have any beneficial effects on asymptomatic or mild‐to‐moderate cholelithiasis. Definitive conclusions will require much better designed randomised trials to reduce risk of bias and allow detailed assessment of clinical outcomes. Plain language summary Chinese medicinal herbs for cholelithiasis Cholelithiasis (gallstone disease) causes significant morbidity, severe complications, and economic burden worldwide. Though current surgical therapies are effective for gallstones, some types of gallstones (e.g., calcium bilirubinate calculi) cannot easily be eradicated by surgery and they often recur in the bile duct system, putting people at high risk of severe complications. The objective of this review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of Chinese medicinal herbs for people with cholelithiasis. Though some Chinese medicinal herbs appear to be safe for people with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease, they have not been conclusively shown to have curative effects on gallstones due to the low methodological quality (high risk of bias) of the included trials. Thus, randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias should be conducted to assess the effects of Chinese medicinal herbs before they can be used widely in the clinic.",Chinese medicinal herbs for cholelithiasis,Gan and  T; Chen and  J; Jin and  SJ; Wang and  Y,2,3,,
CD003737.PUB4,"Abstract - Background The clinical management of intermittent exotropia (X(T)) has been discussed extensively in the literature, yet there remains a lack of clarity regarding indications for intervention, the most effective form of treatment, and whether there is an optimal time in the evolution of the disease at which any given treatment should be carried out. Objectives The objective of this review was to analyze the effects of various surgical and non‐surgical treatments in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with intermittent exotropia, and to report intervention criteria and determine whether the treatment effect varies by age and subtype of X(T). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS); the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 20 January 2021. We performed manual searches of the  British Orthoptic Journal  up to 2002, and the proceedings of the European Strabismological Association (ESA), International Strabismological Association (ISA), and American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus meeting (AAPOS) up to 2001. Selection criteria We included RCTs of any surgical or non‐surgical treatment for intermittent exotropia. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methodology. Main results We included six RCTs, four of which took place in the United States, and the remaining two in Asia (Turkey, India). A total of 890 participants with basic or distance X(T) were included, most of whom were children aged 12 months to 10 years. Three of these six studies were from the 2013 version of this review. Overall, the included studies had a high risk of performance bias as masking of participants and personnel administering treatment was not possible. Two RCTs compared bilateral lateral rectus recession versus unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection, but only one RCT (n = 197) reported on the primary outcomes of this review. Bilateral lateral rectus recession likely results in little difference in motor alignment at near (MD 1.00, 95% CI −2.69 to 4.69) and distance (MD 2.00, 95% CI −1.22 to 5.22) fixation as measured in pupillary distance using PACT (moderate‐certainty evidence). Bilateral lateral rectus recession may result in little to no difference in stereoacuity at near fixation (risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.71), adverse events (RR 7.36, 95% CI 0.39 to 140.65), or quality of life measures (low‐certainty evidence). We conducted a meta‐analysis of two RCTs comparing patching (n = 249) with active observation (n = 252), but were unable to conduct further meta‐analyses due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity in the remaining trials. We found evidence that patching was clinically more effective than active observation in improving motor alignment at near (mean difference (MD) −2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) −4.02 to −0.44) and distance (MD −2.00, 95% CI −3.40 to −0.61) fixation as measured by prism and alternate cover test (PACT) at six months (high‐certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that patching results in little to no difference in stereoacuity at near fixation (MD 0.00, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.07) (low‐certainty evidence). Stereoacuity at distance, motor fusion test, and quality of life measures were not reported. Adverse events were also not reported, but study authors explained that they were not anticipated due to the non‐surgical nature of patching. One RCT (n = 38) compared prism adaptation test with eye muscle surgery versus eye muscle surgery alone. No review outcomes were reported. One RCT (n = 60) compared lateral rectus recession and medial rectus plication versus lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection. Lateral rectus recession and medial rectus plication may not improve motor alignment at distance (MD 0.66, 95% CI −1.06 to 2.38) (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence for the effect of lateral rectus recession and medial rectus plication on motor fusion test performance is very uncertain (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.74) (very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Patching confers a clinical benefit in children aged 12 months to 10 years of age with basic‐ or distance‐type X(T) compared with active observation. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether interventions such as bilateral lateral rectus recession versus unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection; lateral rectus recession and medial rectus plication versus lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection; and prism adaptation test prior to eye muscle surgery versus eye muscle surgery alone may confer any benefit. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? Key messages · Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. · Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. · Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. What is intermittent exotropia? Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: · eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements; · glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together; · eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and · covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out: · which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and · whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: · patching against observation (two studies); and · different treatments involving surgery (four studies). Patching compared to observation The evidence: · shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and · suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. Different surgical procedures The evidence suggests that: · surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; · these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and · there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. What are the limitations of the evidence? The evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is current to January 2021.",Interventions for intermittent exotropia,Pang and  Y; Gnanaraj and  L; Gayleard and  J; Han and  G; Hatt and  SR,2,3,,
CD003674.PUB4,"Abstract - Background There is a lack of consensus on the best management of the acute Achilles tendon rupture. Treatment can be broadly classified into surgical (open or percutaneous) and non‐surgical (cast immobilisation or functional bracing). Objectives To evaluate the relative effects of surgical versus non‐surgical treatment, or different surgical interventions, for acute Achilles tendon ruptures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (July 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to 20th July 2009), EMBASE (1966 to 2009 week 29), CINAHL (1983 to July 2007) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing surgical versus non‐surgical treatment or different surgical methods for acute Achilles tendon ruptures in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected potentially eligible trials; trials were then assessed for quality using a 10‐item scale. Where possible, data were pooled. Main results Twelve trials involving 844 participants were included. One trial tested two comparisons. Quality assessment revealed a poor level of methodological rigour in many studies, particularly with regard to concealment of allocation and the lack of assessor blinding. Open surgical treatment compared with non‐surgical treatment (6 trials, 536 participants) was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of rerupture (risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.77), but a higher risk of other complications including infection (RR 4.89, 95% CI 1.09 to 21.91), adhesions and disturbed skin sensibility (numbness). Functional status including sporting activity was variably and often incompletely reported, including frequent use of non standardised outcome measures, and the results were inconclusive. Open surgical repair compared with percutaneous repair (4 trials, 174 participants) was associated with a higher risk of infection (RR 9.32, 95% CI 1.77 to 49.16). These figures should be interpreted with caution because of the small numbers involved. Similarly, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different tendon repair techniques (3 trials, 147 participants). Authors' conclusions Open surgical treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of rerupture compared with non‐surgical treatment, but produces significantly higher risks of other complications, including wound infection. The latter may be reduced by performing surgery percutaneously. Plain language summary Surgical interventions for treating acute Achilles tendon ruptures Rupture of the Achilles tendon is common and said to be increasing. It typically occurs in males in their 30s and 40s who play sport intermittently. People present with severe pain in the tendon, at the back of the ankle. Signs include a palpable gap at the rupture site, and marked weakness of ankle plantar‐flexion (movement so toes point downwards). Options for management include non‐surgical interventions (plaster of Paris, bracing or splinting) or surgical repair of the tendon. Following either method of treatment, the ankle may be immobilised for up to 12 weeks (in a cast, allowing no movement at the ankle and variable weight‐bearing), or mobilised early (in a brace, allowing movement at the ankle and partial to full weight‐bearing). Twelve trials including 794 participants acute Achilles tendon rupture were included. The majority of participants were male, and the average ages of the study populations were between 36 to 41 years. Many of the trials had flawed methods that undermined the reliability of their results. Open surgical treatment compared with non‐surgical treatment (6 studies, 502 participants) was associated with a lower risk of rerupture, but a higher risk of other complications such as infection, adhesions and disturbed skin sensibility (numbness and tingling). There were insufficient and inconclusive data on function and sporting activities. Percutaneous repair (involving stab incisions through which the repair suture is passed through without direct exposure of the tendon) compared with open repair (4 studies, 174 participants) was associated with a lower risk of infection. These figures should be interpreted with caution because of the small numbers involved. Similarly, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different tendon repair techniques (3 studies, 141 participants).",Surgical interventions for treating acute Achilles tendon ruptures,Khan and  RJK; Carey Smith and  RL,2,3,,
CD006212.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Pulmonary emboli (PE), or blood clots in the lungs,can be potentially fatal. Anticoagulation is the first line therapy to prevent PE. In some instances anticoagulation fails to prevent more emboli, or cannot be given because the person has a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena caval filters (VCFs) are metal alloy devices that mechanically trap fragmented emboli from the deep leg veins en route to the pulmonary circulation. Retrievable filters are designed to be introduced and removed percutaneously. Although their deployment seems of theoretical benefit, their clinical efficacy and adverse event profile is unclear. This is the third update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007. Objectives To assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of vena caval filters (VCFs) in preventing pulmonary embolism (PE). Search methods For this review update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (last searched 10 September 2019) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2019, Issue 8) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online. The CIS also searched MEDLINE Ovid, EMBASE Ovid, CINAHL, and AMED (1 January 2017 to 10 September 2019) and trials registries to 10 September 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that examined the efficacy of VCFs in preventing PE. Data collection and analysis For this update, studies were assessed and data extracted independently. We assessed study quality with Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence. The outcomes of interest were PE, mortality, lower limb venous thrombosis, filter‐related complications and major bleeding. Main results We identified four new studies for this update, bringing the total to six included studies involving 1388 participants. The six studies were clinically heterogeneous and we were unable to carry out meta‐analysis. Only two studies were considered to be both applicable in current clinical settings and of good methodological quality. One was a randomised open‐label trial studying the effect of a retrievable inferior vena caval filter plus anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone on risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) in 399 participants over three months. There was no evidence of a difference in the rates of PE, death, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or bleeding at three and six months after the intervention (moderate‐certainty evidence). A filter was inserted in 193 people, but could only be successfully retrieved from 153. Minor filter complications were noted at six months. The second clinically relevant study was a randomised open‐label trial of 240 participants who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries, allocated to a filter or no filter, three days after injury, in conjunction with anticoagulation and intermittent pneumatic compression. Prophylactic anticoagulation was initiated in both groups when it was thought safe to do so. There was no evidence of a difference in symptomatic PE, death, or lower limb venous thrombosis rates (moderate‐certainty evidence). The only major filter complication was that one person required surgical removal of the filter. We are unable to draw any conclusions from the remaining four included studies. One study showed an increased incidence of long‐term lower extremity DVT at eight years. Three studies are no longer clinically applicable because they utilised permanent filters which are seldom used now, or they did not use routine prophylactic anticoagulation which is current standard practice. The fourth study compared two filter types and was terminated prematurely as one filter group had a higher rate of thrombosis compared to the other filter type. Authors' conclusions Two of the six identified studies were relevant for current clinical settings. One showed no evidence of a benefit of retrievable filters in acute PE for the outcomes of PE, death, DVT and bleeding during the initial three months in people who can receive anticoagulation (moderate‐certainty evidence). The other study did not show any benefit for prophylactic filter insertion in people who sustained multiple traumatic injuries, with respect to symptomatic PE, mortality, or lower extremity venous thrombosis (moderate‐certainty evidence). We can draw no firm conclusions regarding filter efficacy in the prevention of PE from the remaining four RCTs identified in this review. Further trials are needed to assess vena caval filter effectiveness and safety, and clinical differences between various filter types. Plain language summary Vena caval filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism Background Blood clots in the lungs are called pulmonary emboli. They commonly originate in the leg or pelvic veins, where they can fragment and travel to the lungs via the inferior vena cava (IVC, large vein which carries blood from the lower body to the heart). Further emboli are usually prevented by blood thinning medications (anticoagulants). In some instances (approximately 4% of cases), anticoagulation fails, or it is too dangerous to give anticoagulation. Vena caval filters are metal alloy devices inserted within the IVC to trap blood clots. Modern filters are 'retrievable,' allowing their removal once they are no longer required. However, a number of retrievable filters are not removed. The long‐term safety profile of these devices is not known. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of vena caval filters. The review authors looked for studies comparing filters with no filter, and studies comparing different filter designs. Study characteristics and key results We included six trials with a total of 1388 participants in the review (current until 10 September 2019). There were too many differences between these studies so we could not combine the results. Two trials were applicable in current clinical settings. One trial showed there is no clear benefit in receiving a retrievable filter for the first three months after an acute PE, for those who can receive anticoagulation, in terms of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), death or bleeding. Not all filters could be removed. Only minor complications from the filters were noted at six months. Another study of people who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries did not show any benefit of inserting a filter three days after injury to prevent PE, or reduce deaths. Preventive anticoagulation and calf compression devices were administered to participants when possible. We are unable to draw any conclusions from the remaining four included studies. This is because three studies are no longer clinically relevant because they utilised permanent filters which are seldom used now, or they did not use routine preventative anticoagulation which is current standard practice. One study showed an increased rate of lower‐extremity DVT in the permanent filter group. The fourth study compared two filter types and was stopped prematurely and thus did not generate sufficient data. Reliability of the evidence Two studies were relevant in current clinical contexts. The evidence presented by both of these studies is of moderate certainty. We reached this assessment because we were not able to combine the data from the studies, and because of the low numbers of participants and events involved. The studies differed in type of participants and clinical situations. There is a further need for trials evaluating the effectiveness of caval filters in people who cannot receive anticoagulation, or when PE occurs despite adequate anticoagulation.",Vena caval filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism,Young and  T; Sriram and  KB,3,2,,
CD005340.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Ovarian cancer tends to be chemosensitive and confine itself to the surface of the peritoneal cavity for much of its natural history. These features have made it an obvious target for intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is usually given as an intravenous (IV) infusion repeatedly over five to eight cycles. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is given by infusion of the chemotherapeutic agent directly into the peritoneal cavity. There are biological reasons why this might increase the anticancer effect and reduce some systemic adverse effects in comparison to IV therapy. Objectives To determine if adding a component of the chemotherapy regime into the peritoneal cavity affects overall survival, progression‐free survival, quality of life (QOL) and toxicity in the primary treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. Search methods We searched the Gynaecological Cancer Review Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2011, MEDLINE (1951 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011). We updated these searches in February 2007, August 2010, May 2011 and September 2015. In addition, we handsearched and cascade searched the major gynaecological oncology journals up to May 2011. Selection criteria The analysis was restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing women with a new diagnosis of primary epithelial ovarian cancer, of any FIGO stage, following primary cytoreductive surgery. Standard IV chemotherapy was compared with chemotherapy that included a component of IP administration. Data collection and analysis We extracted data on overall survival, disease‐free survival, adverse events and QOL and performed meta‐analyses of hazard ratios (HR) for time‐to‐event variables and relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes using RevMan software. Main results Nine randomised trials studied 2119 women receiving primary treatment for ovarian cancer. We considered six trials to be of high quality. Women were less likely to die if they received an IP component to chemotherapy (eight studies, 2026 women; HR = 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72 to 0.90). Intraperitoneal component chemotherapy prolonged the disease‐free interval (five studies, 1311 women; HR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.86). There was greater serious toxicity with regard to gastrointestinal effects, pain, fever and infection but less ototoxicity with the IP than the IV route. Authors' conclusions Intraperitoneal chemotherapy increases overall survival and progression‐free survival from advanced ovarian cancer. The results of this meta‐analysis provide the most reliable estimates of the relative survival benefits of IP over IV therapy and should be used as part of the decision making process. However, the potential for catheter related complications and toxicity needs to be considered when deciding on the most appropriate treatment for each individual woman. The optimal dose, timing and mechanism of administration cannot be addressed from this meta‐analysis. This needs to be addressed in the next phase of clinical trials. Plain language summary Intraperitoneal chemotherapy (administered into the peritoneal cavity) for advanced ovarian cancer improves both overall and disease‐free survival Ovarian cancer commonly spreads through the peritoneal cavity and usually responds to intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. This review compared the effectiveness of IV chemotherapy to chemotherapy administered directly into the peritoneal cavity (intraperitoneal, or IP). The evidence suggests an improvement in survival if some of the chemotherapy is administered via the intraperitoneal route. The disadvantage is an increase in adverse effects principally relating to the presence of a peritoneal catheter, including pain, catheter blockage, gastrointestinal effects and infection.",Intraperitoneal chemotherapy for the initial management of primary epithelial ovarian cancer,Jaaback and  K; Johnson and  N; Lawrie and  TA,2,3,,
CD001934.PUB2,"Abstract - Background This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in  The Cochrane Library  in Issue 2, 2001 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009. Vocal cord nodules are bilateral, benign, callous‐like growths of the mid‐portion of the membranous vocal folds. They are of variable size and are characterised histologically by thickening of the epithelium with a variable degree of inflammation in the underlying superficial lamina propria. They characteristically produce hoarseness, discomfort and an unstable voice when speaking or singing. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of surgery versus non‐surgical interventions for vocal cord nodules. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 9 April 2012. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing any surgical intervention for vocal cord nodules with non‐surgical treatment or no treatment. Data collection and analysis No suitable trials were identified. Main results No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions There is a need for high‐quality randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and non‐surgical treatment of vocal cord nodules. Plain language summary Surgery versus non‐surgical interventions (voice therapy, medical treatment) for the resolution of vocal cord nodules Vocal cord nodules are benign, callous‐like growths on the vocal cords. Symptoms include hoarseness, throat discomfort, pain and an unstable voice when speaking or singing. They can be caused by 'voice abuse' (prolonged shouting or singing above the individual's own range) but may also be caused by infection, allergy or acid reflux. Vocal cord nodules can be surgically removed but may also be treated with non‐surgical voice therapy interventions (e.g. voice re‐training, rest or hygiene advice) or medical/pharmacological treatment of underlying infections, allergy or gastroesophageal reflux. The authors of this review sought to identify trials which compared surgical with non‐surgical treatment. They found that there was not enough evidence to compare surgery to other treatment options.

CD007404.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) of the jaws is a rare benign tumour with an unknown aetiology accounting for up to 7% of tumours in the mandible (lower jaw) and the maxilla (upper jaw). Objectives This systematic review focused on assessing the effects of primary non‐surgical versus primary surgical interventions or any other treatment or placebo for treating central giant cell granuloma of the jaws. Search methods Relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (July 2009); CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2009, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to July 2009); EMBASE (1980 to July 2009); and LILACS (1982 to July 2009). We scanned bibliographies of relevant studies for possible references to additional trials as well as prospective clinical trial registries. Eligible RCTs were included regardless of the language of publication. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials involving a comparison of primary non‐surgical interventions with primary surgical interventions or any other treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed. Main results We did not find any study evaluating the effects of primary surgical versus primary non‐surgical interventions for central giant cell granuloma of the jaws. However, we included and analysed one RCT with unclear risk of bias, evaluating the effects of calcitonin versus placebo for central giant cell granuloma of the jaws. No significant difference was found in the proportion of patients with increased volume of more than 10% of the lesion compared to the pretreatment measurement at 3 months of follow‐up (one RCT, 14 participants; risk ratio (RR) 3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 22.30). Authors' conclusions We did not find RCTs evaluating the effects of primary surgical versus primary non‐surgical interventions for central giant cell granuloma of the jaws. Although a number of non‐surgical therapies have been proposed for treating central giant cell granuloma of the jaws, our review did not identify evidence from RCTs to support their use. More research is needed on this topic. Plain language summary Interventions for central giant cell granuloma of the jaws The central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) of the jaws is a rare benign tumour of the mandible (lower jaw) and the maxilla (upper jaw) characterized by destruction of the bone, loss of symmetry of the face and displacement of teeth and tooth germs, especially in younger patients. Aggressive types of tumours are usually expansive and rapidly grow, causing pain, bleeding, and displaced and loose teeth. The management of CGCG can include conventional surgery with or without medical adjunctive treatment or resection in‐bloc for the aggressive variant. Although the most common therapy is surgical curettage, the high recurrence rate, especially in aggressive lesions, has raised concern and led to a search for other treatment options. This review compared primary non‐surgical interventions versus primary surgical or other treatments. Although a number of therapies have been proposed for treating central giant cell granuloma of the jaws, our review did not identify evidence from randomised controlled trials to support their use. Our review only identified one study comparing calcitonin to placebo.

CD005375.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Scoliosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is usually progressive and is treated with surgery. However, it is unclear whether the existing evidence is sufficiently scientifically rigorous to support a recommendation for spinal surgery for most patients with DMD and scoliosis. This is an updated review, and an updated search was undertaken in which no new studies were found for inclusion. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of spinal surgery in patients with DMD with scoliosis. We intended to test whether spinal surgery is effective in increasing survival and improving respiratory function, quality of life, and overall functioning, and whether spinal surgery is associated with severe adverse effects. Search methods On 16 June 2015 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus. We also searched ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis database (January 1980 to June 2015), the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Database (6 January 2015), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (17 June 2015), and checked references. We imposed no language restrictions. Selection criteria We planned to include controlled clinical trials using random or quasi‐random allocation of treatment evaluating all forms of spinal surgery for scoliosis in patients with DMD in the review. The control interventions would have been no treatment, non‐operative treatment, or a different form of spinal surgery. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently examined the search results and evaluated the study characteristics against inclusion criteria in order to decide which studies to include in the review. Main results Of the 49 relevant studies we found, none met the inclusion criteria for the review because they were not clinical trials, but prospective or retrospective reviews of case series. Authors' conclusions Since no randomized controlled clinical trials were available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in patients with DMD, we can make no good evidence‐based conclusion to guide clinical practice. Patients with scoliosis should be informed as to the uncertainty of benefits and potential risks of surgery for scoliosis. Randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery, in terms of quality of life, functional status, respiratory function, and life expectancy. Plain language summary Surgery for curvature of the spine in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy Review question What is the effectiveness and safety of spinal surgery to treat scoliosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? Background Scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, is common in patients with DMD. It is usually progressive, and surgery is often performed to halt its progression, improve cosmetic appearance, facilitate care, preserve upper limb and respiratory function, and hopefully increase life expectancy. We wished to learn whether spinal surgery was better or worse than the alternatives. Study characteristics We found no randomized controlled trials. Key results and quality of the evidence We found 49 relevant studies, however they were not clinical trials but prospective or retrospective reviews of case series. The quality of evidence was very low because no clinical trial was available. This is an updated review, and an updated search was undertaken in which no new studies were found. Conclusion No randomized controlled clinical trials are available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in patients with DMD. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed in this group of patients to evaluate the benefits and risks of different surgical treatments.

CD006839.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether: ‐ surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; ‐ conservative treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; ‐ it is possible to identify the best treatment on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, or nerve imaging assessment. Search methods On 31 May 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also searched PEDro (14 October 2016), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. On 4 July 2016 we searched trials registries for ongoing or unpublished trials. Selection criteria The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information. Main results We identified nine RCTs (587 participants) for inclusion in the review, of which three studies were found at this update. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in three studies. We performed two meta‐analyses to evaluate the clinical (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological (2 trials, 101 participants) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition; four trials in total examined this comparison. We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08; moderate‐quality evidence) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 3.87). The number of participants to clinically improve was 91 out of 131 in the simple decompression group and 97 out of 130 in the transposition group. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85; moderate‐quality evidence). In one trial (47 participants), the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in clinical and neurophysiological outcomes. In one trial (48 participants), the investigators compared subcutaneous transposition with submuscular transposition and found no difference in clinical outcomes. In one trial (54 participants for 56 nerves treated), the authors found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function. One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate UNE. Based on low‐quality evidence, the trial authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to information provision did not result in further improvement. One trial (55 participants) assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and found no difference versus placebo in improving symptoms at three months' follow‐up. Authors' conclusions We found only two studies of treatment of ulnar neuropathy using conservative treatment as the comparator. The available comparative treatment evidence is not sufficient to support a multiple treatment meta‐analysis to identify the best treatment for idiopathic UNE on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with this condition conservatively or surgically. Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Decompression with transposition is associated with more deep and superficial wound infections than simple decompression, also based on moderate‐quality evidence. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma. Evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort. Plain language summary Treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) Review question What are the effects of treatments for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)? Background Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is the second most common type of condition in which a nerve becomes trapped or compressed (the most common affects the wrist). The ulnar nerve travels down the side of the elbow. This nerve is important for movement and the sense of touch in the hand at the little finger side. Symptoms of UNE are tingling of the fourth and fifth finger at night, pain at the elbow, and a change in sense of touch if the elbow is bent for a long time. When UNE is severe, some hand muscles can become weak. Diagnosis is by the symptoms and signs of the condition, as well as neurophysiological tests. Treatment of UNE can be surgical or nonsurgical (e.g. splints, physical therapy, and rehabilitation). The best way to treat UNE remains unclear. Study characteristics We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nonsurgical treatment. One RCT compared three groups of people with mild or moderate UNE (51 people in total). All three groups received written instructions to avoid movements or positions that provoked symptoms. The second group had the same information with elbow splints at night for three months. The third group had the same information with nerve gliding exercises. The other nonsurgical study (55 people) compared a corticosteroid injection with a sham injection. Seven RCTs compared different surgical methods: • simple decompression or transposition of the nerve (submuscular or subcutaneous transposition) (4 trials, 327 participants); • medial epicondylectomy or anterior transposition (1 trial, 47 participants); • anterior subcutaneous transposition or anterior submuscular transposition (1 trial, 48 participants); • keyhole or open surgery (1 trial, 54 participants with 56 trapped nerves). Key results and quality of the evidence Written information alone was as effective in improving work activities and reducing pain at night as when people also used splints or did exercises. Researchers found no evidence that corticosteroid injection was effective in improving symptoms of UNE. We were able to combine results from three trials comparing two surgical techniques: simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve (subcutaneous or submuscular). We found no important difference in symptom scores between the techniques at 6 to 12 months. Decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. Trialists found no clinical differences between surgical techniques in the other surgical trials. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma (an abnormal collection of blood) after surgery. Evidence was insufficient for us to choose the best treatment for UNE. However, we did find that in mild cases, information on movements and positions to avoid may reduce discomfort. Moreover, the combined results from three surgical trials provided moderate‐quality evidence that simple decompression surgery and decompression with transposition may be equally effective, but that decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. The evidence is up to date to 31 May 2016.",Treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow,Caliandro and  P; La Torre and  G; Padua and  R; Giannini and  F; Padua and  L,2,3,,
CD000380.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Ankle sprains are one of the most commonly treated musculoskeletal injuries. The three main treatment modalities for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries are immobilisation with plaster cast or splint, 'functional treatment' comprising early mobilisation and use of an external support (e.g. ankle brace), and surgical repair or reconstruction. Objectives We aimed to compare surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2006), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005), EMBASE, CINAHL and reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers in the field. This review is considered updated to January 2006. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions for treating ankle sprains in adults. Data collection and analysis At least two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. We performed sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the findings. Main results Twenty trials were included. These involved a total of 2562 mostly young active adult males. All trials had methodological weaknesses. Specifically, concealment of allocation was confirmed in only one trial. Data for pooling individual outcomes were only available for a maximum of 12 trials and under 60% of participants. The findings of statistically significant differences in favour of the surgical treatment group for the four primary outcomes (non‐return to pre‐injury level of sports; ankle sprain recurrence; long‐term pain; subjective or functional instability) when using the fixed‐effect model were not robust when using the random‐effects model, nor on the removal of one low quality (quasi‐randomised) trial that had more extreme results. A corresponding drop in the I² statistics showed the remaining trials to be more homogeneous. The functional implications of the statistically significantly higher incidence of objective instability in conservatively treated trial participants are uncertain. There was some limited evidence for longer recovery times, and higher incidences of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in the surgical treatment group. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence available from randomised controlled trials to determine the relative effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle. High quality randomised controlled trials of primary surgical repair versus the best available conservative treatment for well‐defined injuries are required. Plain language summary Surgery versus conservative treatment for acute ankle sprains in adults Ankle sprain is one of the commonest musculoskeletal injuries in active people. It generally involves damage to the lateral or outer ligaments, which connect bones together on the outside of the ankle joint. Treatment is usually either immobilisation of the leg in a plaster cast, or 'functional treatment' where the ankle is kept in use while protected by an external support. After treatment, however, some people still have a weak and sometimes painful ankle. This review aimed to find out if primary surgical repair of the torn ligament(s) gives a better result than either of these two non‐surgical or conservative treatments. Twenty trials were included. These involved a total of 2562 mostly young active adult males. All trials had methodological flaws that could have affected their results. Data for pooling individual outcomes were only available for a maximum of 12 trials. Additionally, there was one low quality and potentially biased trial with very positive results in favour of surgery. When this trial was excluded, the findings of better results for surgery in terms of return to sports, re‐injury, persistent pain and ankle instability as judged by the patient were no longer statistically significant. Thus, the trend to a better result from surgery remains unproven. Ankle stability, as judged by the clinician using standard tests, was better after surgery than with conservative treatment. Conversely, there was some limited evidence for longer recovery times, and higher incidences of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in the surgical treatment group. We concluded that there was not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to say whether surgery gives a better result than conservative treatment for acute ankle sprain in adults.",Surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults,Kerkhoffs and  GMMJ; Handoll and  HHG; de Bie and  R; Rowe and  BH; Struijs and  PAA,2,3,,
CD010651.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Empyema refers to pus in the pleural space, commonly due to adjacent pneumonia, chest wall injury, or a complication of thoracic surgery. A range of therapeutic options are available for its management, ranging from percutaneous aspiration and intercostal drainage to video‐assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or thoracotomy drainage. Intrapleural fibrinolytics may also be administered following intercostal drain insertion to facilitate pleural drainage. There is currently a lack of consensus regarding optimal treatment. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of surgical versus non‐surgical treatments for complicated parapneumonic effusion or pleural empyema. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 9), MEDLINE (Ebscohost) (1946 to July week 3 2013, July 2015 to October 2016) and MEDLINE (Ovid) (1 May 2013 to July week 1 2015), Embase (2010 to October 2016), CINAHL (1981 to October 2016) and LILACS (1982 to October 2016) on 20 October 2016. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing studies (December 2016). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared a surgical with a non‐surgical method of management for all age groups with pleural empyema. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked the data for accuracy. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 391 participants. Six trials focused on children and two on adults. Trials compared tube thoracostomy drainage (non‐surgical), with or without intrapleural fibrinolytics, to either VATS or thoracotomy (surgical) for the management of pleural empyema. Assessment of risk of bias for the included studies was generally unclear for selection and blinding but low for attrition and reporting bias. Data analyses compared thoracotomy versus tube thoracostomy and VATS versus tube thoracostomy. We pooled data for meta‐analysis where appropriate. We performed a subgroup analysis for children along with a sensitivity analysis for studies that used fibrinolysis in non‐surgical treatment arms. The comparison of open thoracotomy versus thoracostomy drainage included only one study in children, which reported no deaths in either treatment arm. However, the trial showed a statistically significant reduction in mean hospital stay of 5.90 days for those treated with primary thoracotomy. It also showed a statistically significant reduction in procedural complications for those treated with thoracotomy compared to thoracostomy drainage. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for length of hospital stay and procedural complications outcomes to moderate due to the small sample size. The comparison of VATS versus thoracostomy drainage included seven studies, which we pooled in a meta‐analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality or procedural complications between groups. This was true for both adults and children with or without fibrinolysis. However, mortality data were limited: one study reported one death in each treatment arm, and seven studies reported no deaths. There was a statistically significant reduction in mean length of hospital stay for those treated with VATS. The subgroup analysis showed the same result in adults, but there was insufficient evidence to estimate an effect for children. We could not perform a separate analysis for fibrinolysis for this outcome because all included studies used fibrinolysis in the non‐surgical arms. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low for mortality (due to wide confidence intervals and indirectness), and moderate for other outcomes in this comparison due to either high heterogeneity or wide confidence intervals. Authors' conclusions Our findings suggest there is no statistically significant difference in mortality between primary surgical and non‐surgical management of pleural empyema for all age groups. Video‐assisted thoracoscopic surgery may reduce length of hospital stay compared to thoracostomy drainage alone. There was insufficient evidence to assess the impact of fibrinolytic therapy. A number of common outcomes were reported in the included studies that were not directly examined in our primary and secondary outcomes. These included duration of chest tube drainage, duration of fever, analgesia requirement, and total cost of treatment. Future studies focusing on patient‐centred outcomes, such as patient functional scores, and other clinically relevant outcomes, such as radiographic improvement, treatment failure rates, and amount of fluid drainage, are needed to inform clinical decisions. Plain language summary Surgical versus non‐surgical treatment for pus in the space around the lungs Review question We investigated if there was a difference in outcomes for patients who develop pus in the space around the lungs (empyema) among those who had surgical treatment and people who had non‐surgical treatment. We looked for differences in proportions of children and adults who survived, time in hospital, and complications from treatments. Background Pus can form in the space around the lungs as a result of pneumonia, complication of chest wall trauma, or surgery. Solid divisions, called loculations, can form within the pus. The infection does not usually improve with antibiotic treatment alone. There are several surgical and non‐surgical treatments. Non‐surgical treatments include draining pus using a needle inserted through the chest wall (thoracentesis) or by inserting a tube through the chest wall to drain infection (thoracostomy). If a chest tube is inserted, drugs can be injected into the space around the lungs to break down the divisions. This is called fibrinolysis. Non‐surgical treatments can cause harms, including air in the space around the lungs, damage to chest tissue, or lungs filling with fluid as they re‐expand. Surgical treatment involves either opening the chest cavity and clearing out the infection (thoracotomy) or clearing out infection through small cuts on the chest wall with the aid of a camera, known as video‐assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). A chest tube drains any fluids after surgery. Risks from surgery include air in the space around the lungs, rib pain, and anaesthetic complications. Search date The evidence is current to October 2016. Study characteristics We included eight trials with a total of 391 participants. Six trials focused on children and two on adults. The trials compared chest tube drainage (non‐surgical), with or without fibrinolysis, to either VATS or thoracotomy (surgical). Study funding sources Two studies declared no financial conflicts of interest; the remaining six studies did not report funding source. Key results There was no difference in the proportion of patients of all ages who survived empyema in relation to surgical or non‐surgical treatment. However, this finding was based on limited data: one study reported one death with each treatment option, and seven studies reported no deaths. There was no difference in rates of complications between patients treated with surgical or non‐surgical options. There was limited evidence to suggest that VATS reduced length of stay in hospital compared to non‐surgical treatments. Quality of evidence The quality of the evidence was moderate overall. The main limitations were few included studies for each analysis and inconsistencies among studies.",Surgical versus non‐surgical management for pleural empyema,Redden and  MD; Chin and  TY; van Driel and  ML,3,1,,
CD013034.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Patellar tendinopathy is an overuse condition that commonly affects athletes. Surgery is usually offered if medical and physical therapies fail to treat it effectively. There is variation in the type of surgery performed for the condition. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of surgery for patellar tendinopathy in adults. Search methods We searched the following databases, to 17 July 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Library, OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, clinical trial registries ( www.ClinicalTrials.gov ) and the WHO trials portal ( www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ). Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared surgical techniques (open or arthroscopic) with non‐operative treatment (including placebo surgery, exercise or other non‐surgical modalities) in adults with patellar tendinopathy. Major outcomes assessed were knee pain, function, quality of life, participant global assessment of success, withdrawal rate, proportion with adverse events and proportion with tendon rupture. Data collection and analysis Two review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted trial characteristics and outcome data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results Two trials (92 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Participants in both trials were followed for 12 months. Neither trial compared surgery to placebo surgery. One trial (40 randomised participants) compared open surgical excision with eccentric exercises, and the other compared arthroscopic surgery with sclerosing injections (52 randomised participants). Due to the nature of the interventions, neither the participants or the investigators were blinded to the group allocation, resulting in the potential for performance and detection bias. Some outcomes were selectively not recorded, leading to reporting bias. Overall, the certainty of the evidence from these studies was low for all outcomes due to the potential for bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes. Compared with eccentric exercises, low‐certainty evidence indicates that open surgical excision provides no clinically important benefits with respect to knee pain, function or global assessment of success. At 12 months, mean knee pain — measured by pain with standing jump on a 10‐point scale (lower scores indicating less pain) — was 1.7 points (standard deviation (SD) 1.6) in the eccentric training group and 1.3 (SD 0.8) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%) and a relative reduction in pain of 10% better (ranging from 30% better to 10% worse) in the treatment group. At 12 months, function on the zero‐ to 100‐point Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) scale was 65.7 (SD 23.8) in the eccentric training group and 72.9 (SD 11.7) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute change of 7% better function (ranging from 4% worse to 19% better) and relative change of 25% better (ranging from 15% worse to 65% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 13%). Participant global assessment of success was measured by the number of people with no pain at 12 months: 7/20 participants in the eccentric training group reported no pain, compared with 5/20 in the open surgical group (risk ratio (RR) 0.71 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.88); one trial, 40 participants). There were no withdrawals, but five out of 20 people from the eccentric exercise group crossed over to open surgical excision. Quality of life, adverse events and tendon ruptures were not measured. Compared with sclerosing injection, low‐certainty evidence indicates that arthroscopic surgery may provide a reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success, however further studies are likely to change these results. At 12 months, mean pain with activities, measured on a 100‐point scale (lower scores indicating less pain), was 41.1 (SD 28.5) in the sclerosing injection group and 12.8 (SD 19.3) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 28% better (ranging from 15% to 42% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%), and a relative change of 41% better (ranging from 21% to 61% better). At 12 months, the mean participant global assessment of success, measured by satisfaction on a 100‐point scale (scale zero to 100, higher scores indicating greater satisfaction), was 52.9 (SD 32.6) in the sclerosing injection group and 86.8 (SD 20.8) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute improvement of 34% (ranging from 19% to 49%). In both groups, one participant (4%) withdrew from the study. Functional outcome scores, including the VISA score, were not reported. Quality‐of‐life assessment, adverse events, and specifically the proportion with a tendon rupture, were not reported. We did not perform subgroup analysis to assess differences in outcome between arthroscopic or open surgical excision, as we did not identify more than one study with a common comparator. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain if surgery is beneficial over other therapeutic interventions, namely eccentric exercises or injectables. Low‐certainty evidence shows that surgery for patellar tendinopathy may not provide clinically important benefits over eccentric exercise in terms of pain, function or participant‐reported treatment success, but may provide clinically meaningful pain reduction and treatment success when compared with sclerosing injections. However, further research is likely to change these results. The evidence was downgraded two levels due to the small sample sizes and susceptibility to bias. We are uncertain if there are additional risks associated with surgery as study authors failed to report adverse events. Surgery seems to be embedded in clinical practice for late‐stage patella tendinopathy, due to exhaustion of other therapeutic methods rather than evidence of benefit. Plain language summary Surgery for patella tendinopathy (jumper's knee) Background Patella tendinopathy is a painful condition that commonly affects jumping athletes who train a lot, for example those who play volleyball and basketball. Many people with the condition are unable to continue their chosen sport at the same level of competition or intensity of training. There are many treatments for the condition, the most common of which is a particular type of exercise called eccentric exercise (where the tendon is under tension while the muscle lengthens). Other treatments for patella tendinopathy include oral and topical analgesia (pain‐relief medication taken orally or applied to the skin), various injectables (e.g. corticosteroids) and surgery. Surgery is used if other treatments fail, and is the treatment assessed in this review. Study characteristics This Cochrane Review is current to July 2018. We searched online databases for all studies (specifically randomised controlled trials) that compared surgical treatment with non‐operative treatment in adults with patellar tendinopathy. We found two studies; they compared open surgical removal to eccentric exercises (one study involving 40 people) and arthroscopic surgery to sclerosing injections (these scar and block the blood vessels supplying nerve fibres to the diseased tendon) (one study involving 56 people). The studies were performed in an outpatient setting in two countries (Norway and Sweden). The majority of people in the studies were male, with a mean age ranging from 27 to 31 years, and mean symptom duration of 24 to 33 months. Trials were conducted without funding (financial support) from industry (medical or device companies), but some authors from the one study received funding from pharmaceutical companies in addition to research funding from non‐industry sources. Key results Compared with eccentric exercises, open surgery offered little benefit at 12 months (results for individual outcomes as follows). Pain (lower scores mean less pain) Improved by 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better) or by 0.4 points on a scale of zero to 10 points. People who had surgery rated their pain as 1.3 points. People who had eccentric exercises rated their pain as 1.7 points. Global assessment of success (those who reported no pain at 12 months) 10% fewer people had no pain (ranging from 38% less to 18% more), or 10 fewer people out of 100. Twenty‐five out of 100 people had no pain with surgery. Thirty‐five out of 100 people had no pain with eccentric exercises. Withdrawals No participants in either group withdrew from the study. The study did not report on quality‐of‐life improvements or adverse events (including tendon ruptures). Compared with sclerosing injections, arthroscopic (keyhole) surgery offered some reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success at 12 months (results for individual outcomes as follows; further studies are likely to change these results). Pain (lower scores mean less pain) Improved by 28% (ranging from 15% to 42% better) or by 28 points on a scale of zero to 100 points. People who had surgery rated their pain as 12.8 points. People who had sclerosing injection rated their pain as 41.1 points. Global assessment of success (participant‐reported success, higher score is better) Improved by 34% (ranging from 19% to 49% better) or by 33.9 points on a scale of zero to 100 points. People who had surgery rated their pain as 86.8 points. People who had sclerosing injection rated their pain as 52.9 points. Withdrawals One person from each group (4%) withdrew from the study for reasons unrelated to the treatment. The study did not report on quality‐of‐life improvements, functional score improve",Surgery for patellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee),Dan and  M; Phillips and  A; Johnston and  RV; Harris and  IA,1,3,,
CD005355.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Benign smooth muscle tumours of the uterus, known as fibroids or myomas, are often symptomless. However, about one‐third of women with fibroids will present with symptoms that are severe enough to warrant treatment. The standard treatment of symptomatic fibroids is hysterectomy (that is surgical removal of the uterus) for women who have completed childbearing, and myomectomy for women who desire future childbearing or simply want to preserve their uterus. Myomectomy, the surgical removal of myomas, can be associated with life‐threatening bleeding. Excessive bleeding can necessitate emergency blood transfusion. Knowledge of the effectiveness of the interventions to reduce bleeding during myomectomy is essential to enable evidence‐based clinical decisions. This is an update of the review published in  The Cochrane Library  (2011, Issue 11). Objectives To assess the effectiveness, safety, tolerability and costs of interventions to reduce blood loss during myomectomy. Search methods In June 2014, we conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and trial registers for ongoing and registered trials. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared potential interventions to reduce blood loss during myomectomy to placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis The two authors independently selected RCTs for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included RCTs. The primary review outcomes were blood loss and need for blood transfusion. We expressed study results as mean differences (MD) for continuous data and odds ratios for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results Eighteen RCTs with 1250 participants met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in hospital settings in low, middle and high income countries. Blood loss We found significant reductions in blood loss with the following interventions: vaginal misoprostol (2 RCTs, 89 women: MD ‐97.88 ml, 95% CI ‐125.52 to ‐70.24; I 2  = 43%; moderate‐quality evidence); intramyometrial vasopressin (3 RCTs, 128 women: MD ‐245.87 ml, 95% CI ‐434.58 to ‐57.16; I 2  = 98%; moderate‐quality evidence); intramyometrial bupivacaine plus epinephrine (1 RCT, 60 women: MD ‐68.60 ml, 95% CI ‐93.69 to ‐43.51; low‐quality evidence); intravenous tranexamic acid (1 RCT, 100 women: MD ‐243 ml, 95% CI ‐460.02 to ‐25.98; low‐quality evidence); gelatin‐thrombin matrix (1 RCT, 50 women: MD ‐545.00 ml, 95% CI ‐593.26 to ‐496.74; low‐quality evidence); intravenous ascorbic acid (1 RCT, 102 women: MD ‐411.46 ml, 95% CI ‐502.58 to ‐320.34; low‐quality evidence); vaginal dinoprostone (1 RCT, 108 women: MD ‐131.60 ml, 95% CI ‐253.42 to ‐9.78; low‐quality evidence); loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule (1 RCT, 70 women: MD ‐305.01 ml, 95% CI ‐354.83 to ‐255.19; low‐quality evidence); a fibrin sealant patch (1 RCT, 70 women: MD ‐26.50 ml, 95% CI ‐44.47 to ‐8.53; low‐quality evidence), a Foley catheter tied around the cervix (1 RCT, 93 women: MD ‐240.70 ml, 95% CI ‐359.61 to ‐121.79; low‐quality evidence), and a polyglactin suture round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament (1 RCT, 28 women: MD ‐1870.0 ml, 95% CI ‐2547.16 to 1192.84; low‐quality evidence). There was no good evidence of an effect on blood loss with oxytocin, morcellation or clipping of the uterine artery. Need for blood transfusion We found significant reductions in the need for blood transfusion with vasopressin (2 RCTs, 90 women: OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.74; I 2  = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence); tourniquet tied round the cervix (1 RCT, 98 women: OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.55; low‐quality evidence); tourniquet tied round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament (1 RCT, 28 women: OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23; low‐quality evidence); gelatin‐thrombin matrix (1 RCT, 100 women: OR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.10; low‐quality evidence) and dinoprostone (1 RCT, 108 women: OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.81; low‐quality evidence), but no evidence of effect on the need for blood transfusion with misoprostol, oxytocin, tranexamic acid, ascorbic acid, loop ligation of the myoma pseudocapsule and a fibrin sealant patch. There were insufficient data on the adverse effects and costs of the different interventions. Authors' conclusions At present there is moderate‐quality evidence that misoprostol or vasopressin may reduce bleeding during myomectomy, and low‐quality evidence that bupivacaine plus epinephrine, tranexamic acid, gelatin‐thrombin matrix, ascorbic acid, dinoprostone, loop ligation, a fibrin sealant patch, a peri‐cervical tourniquet or a tourniquet tied round both cervix and infundibulopelvic ligament may reduce bleeding during myomectomy. There is no evidence that oxytocin, morcellation and temporary clipping of the uterine artery reduce blood loss. Further well designed studies are required to establish the effectiveness, safety and costs of different interventions for reducing blood loss during myomectomy. Plain language summary Interventions to reduce haemorrhage during myomectomy for treating fibroids Background Some women have non‐cancerous growths of the uterus, called fibroids. In a third of cases the fibroids produce symptoms, such as vaginal bleeding, that warrant treatment. The surgical removal of the fibroids, called myomectomy, is one of the treatment options for fibroids. It can be accomplished by either laparotomy (through an incision into the abdomen) or laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). The procedure is associated with heavy bleeding. Many interventions have been used by doctors to reduce bleeding during an operation for removing fibroids but it is unclear whether or not the interventions are effective. Study characteristics The evidence is current to June 2014. The review included 18 studies with a total of 1250 women who had myomectomy for uterine fibroids. All studies compared an intervention to reduce bleeding during myomectomy with either a placebo or no such treatment. Key results The data available suggest that vaginal insertion of misoprostol and infiltration of vasopressin into the uterine muscle are effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. Limited data available also suggest that chemical dissection (such as with mesna), vaginal insertion of dinoprostone, a gelatin‐thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, infusion of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) during surgery, infiltration of a mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine into the uterine muscles, the use of fibrin sealant patch (a surgical patch that improves blood clotting) or a tourniquet around the cervix or around both the cervix and the infundibulopelvic ligamentmay be effective in reducing bleeding during myomectomy. We found limited information on the harms (adverse effects) of the different interventions. Quality of the evidence There is moderate‐quality evidence that misoprostol reduces blood loss by between 70.24 ml and 125.52 ml; with a laparotomy vasopressin reduces blood loss by between 392.51 and 507.49 ml during myomectomy, and by between 121.73 ml and 172.17 ml during laparoscopic myomectomy. There is low‐quality evidence for the rest of the interventions (chemical dissection, dinoprostone, gelatin‐thrombin matrix, tranexamic acid, vitamin C, mixture of bupivacaine and epinephrine, a fibrin sealant patch and the two types of tourniquet).",Interventions to reduce haemorrhage during myomectomy for fibroids,Kongnyuy and  EJ; Wiysonge and  CS,3,2,,
CD004124.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Chronic lateral ankle instability occurs in 10% to 20% of people after an acute ankle sprain. Initial treatment is conservative but if this fails and ligament laxity is present, surgical intervention is considered. Objectives To compare different treatments, conservative or surgical, for chronic lateral ankle instability. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and reference lists of articles, all to February 2010. Selection criteria All identified randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of interventions for chronic lateral ankle instability were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from each study. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. Main results Ten randomised controlled trials were included. Limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of these trials resulted in unclear or high risk of bias assessments relating to allocation concealment, assessor blinding, incomplete and selective outcome reporting. Only limited pooling of the data was possible. Neuromuscular training was the basis of conservative treatment evaluated in four trials. Neuromuscular training compared with no training resulted in better ankle function scores at the end of four weeks training (Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool (AJFAT): mean difference (MD) 3.00, 95% CI 0.3 to 5.70; 1 trial, 19 participants; Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) data: MD 8.83, 95% CI 4.46 to 13.20; 2 trials, 56 participants). The fourth trial (19 participants) found no significant difference in the functional outcome after six weeks training programme on a cyclo‐ergometer with a bi‐directional compared with a traditional uni‐directional pedal. Longer‐term follow‐up data were not available for these four trials. Four studies compared surgical procedures for chronic ankle instability. One trial (40 participants) found more nerve injuries after tenodesis than anatomical reconstruction (risk ratio (RR) 5.50, 95% CI 1.39 to 21.71). One trial (99 participants) comparing dynamic versus static tenodesis excluded 17 patients allocated dynamic tenodesis because their tendons were too thin. The same trial found that dynamic tenodesis resulted in higher numbers of people with unsatisfactory function (RR 8.62, 95% CI 1.97 to 37.77, 82 participants). One trial comparing techniques of lateral ankle ligament reconstruction (60 participants) found that operating time was shorter using the reinsertion technique than the imbrication method (MD ‐9.00 minutes, 95% CI ‐13.48 to ‐4.52).   Two trials (70 participants) compared functional mobilisation with immobilisation after surgery. These found early mobilisation led to earlier return to work (MD ‐2.00 weeks, 95% CI ‐3.06 to ‐0.94; 1 trial) and to sports (MD ‐3.00 weeks, 95% CI ‐4.49 to ‐1.51; 1 trial). Authors' conclusions Neuromuscular training alone appears effective in the short term but whether this advantage would persist on longer‐term follow‐up is not known. While there is insufficient evidence to support any one surgical intervention over another surgical intervention for chronic ankle instability, it is likely that there are limitations to the use of dynamic tenodesis. After surgical reconstruction, early functional rehabilitation appears to be superior to six weeks immobilisation in restoring early function. Plain language summary Chronic lateral ankle instability may be treated with or without surgery Chronic ankle instability is common after an acute lateral ankle sprain. Initial treatment is conservative, either with bracing or neuromuscular training. However, if symptoms persist and the ligaments on the outside of the ankle are elongated or torn, surgery is usually considered. This review includes 10 small and flawed trials that recruited a total of 388 people with chronic ankle instability. Limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of these trials meant that it was difficult to be certain that their results were valid. Three trials compared neuromuscular training with no training. These found a programme of neuromuscular training appears to provide short term improvement in functional stability. One trial testing the use of a special cycle pedal found that it did not make an important difference to function. However, none of these four trials followed‐up patients after the end of treatment. Four trials compared different types of surgical intervention. There was insufficient evidence to strongly support any specific surgical procedure for treating chronic ankle instability. Two trials found that, after surgical reconstruction, early functional rehabilitation enabled patients to return to work and sports quicker than six weeks immobilisation.",Interventions for treating chronic ankle instability,de Vries and  JS; Krips and  R; Sierevelt and  IN; Blankevoort and  L; van Dijk and  CN,2,3,,
CD010989.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Surgery used to be the treatment of choice in cases of blunt hepatic injury, but this approach gradually changed over the last two decades as increasing non‐operative management (NOM) of splenic injury led to its use for hepatic injury. The improvement in critical care monitoring and computed tomographic scanning, as well as the more frequent use of interventional radiology techniques, has helped to bring about this change to non‐operative management. Liver trauma ranges from a small capsular tear, without parenchymal laceration, to massive parenchymal injury with major hepatic vein/retrohepatic vena cava lesions. In 1994, the Organ Injury Scaling Committee of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) revised the Hepatic Injury Scale to have a range from grade I to VI. Minor injuries (grade I or II) are the most frequent liver injuries (80% to 90% of all cases); severe injuries are grade III‐V lesions; grade VI lesions are frequently incompatible with survival. In the medical literature, the majority of patients who have undergone NOM have low‐grade liver injuries. The safety of NOM in high‐grade liver lesions, AAST grade IV and V, remains a subject of debate as a high incidence of liver and collateral extra‐abdominal complications are still described. Objectives To assess the effects of non‐operative management compared to operative management in high‐grade (grade III‐V) blunt hepatic injury. Search methods The search for studies was run on 14 April 2014. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic+Embase (Ovid), PubMed, ISI WOS (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S & CPSI‐SSH), clinical trials registries, conference proceedings, and we screened reference lists. Selection criteria All randomised trials that compare non‐operative management versus operative management in high‐grade blunt hepatic injury. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently applied the selection criteria to relevant study reports. We used standard methodological procedures as defined by the Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We were unable to find any randomised controlled trials of non‐operative management versus operative management in high‐grade blunt hepatic injury. Authors' conclusions In order to further explore the preliminary findings provided by animal models and observational clinical studies that suggests there may be a beneficial effect of non‐operative management versus operative management in high‐grade blunt hepatic injury, large, high quality randomised trials are needed. Plain language summary Is surgery or observation better for people who have a severe blunt injury to the liver? Background The liver is the most commonly affected organ when a person is injured in the abdomen. Abdominal injury is usually caused by motor vehicle crashes, falling, being punched in the stomach, or from other causes. When a person is badly injured in the abdomen, they have a 10% to 15% chance of death. According to previous research, the chance of death following a liver injury has not reduced over the past 30 years. Liver injury is classified on a scale from 1 to 6. A grade 1 injury is least severe, whereas a grade 6 injury is most severe. The majority of people with a grade 6 injury die. Usually, people with grade 1 and 2 liver injuries receive observation as their treatment; so their body can heal naturally. People with higher grade injuries may need surgery. During surgery doctors may stitch the liver together to help it heal. Review question We wanted to find out whether surgery or observation is better for people who have a severe blunt liver injury. Studies were included if people had a liver injury of grade 3, 4 or 5. We were interested in finding out if there is a difference in death, illness, or quality of life. We searched for every randomised controlled trial undertaken worldwide, of surgery or observation for people with grade 3, 4 or 5 liver injury. We searched for trials on 14 April 2014. Results We found no randomised controlled trials on this topic. No studies are included in this review.

CD012742.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Subconjunctival draining minimally‐invasive glaucoma devices such as the Xen gelatin implant and InnFocus stent have been introduced as a treatment to prevent glaucoma progressing. These implants provide a channel to allow aqueous humour from the anterior chamber of the eye to drain into the subconjunctival space on the surface of the eye thus reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) and mimicking the mechanism of the most commonly undertaken glaucoma surgery, trabeculectomy. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of subconjunctival draining minimally‐invasive glaucoma devices in treating people with open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension whose condition is inadequately controlled with drops. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2018, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 10 July 2018. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of Xen gelatin implant or InnFocus MicroShunt to other surgical treatments (other minimally‐invasive glaucoma device techniques, trabeculectomy), laser treatment or medical treatment. We also planned to include trials where these devices were combined with phacoemulsification compared to phacoemulsification alone. Data collection and analysis We planned to have two review authors independently extract data from reports of included studies using a data collection form and analyse data based on methods expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was mean change in IOP. Secondary outcomes included proportion of participants who were drop‐free; proportion of participants who achieved an IOP of 21 mmHg or less, 17 mmHg or less or 14 mmHg or less; and proportion of participants experiencing intra‐ and postoperative complications. We planned to measure all outcomes in the short‐term (six to 18 months), medium‐term (18 to 36 months), and long‐term (36 months onwards). Main results We found no completed RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We found one ongoing study (NCT01881425). The study compares InnFocus MicroShunt to trabeculectomy in people with primary open angle glaucoma. The primary outcome is greater than 20% IOP reduction from baseline to 12 months' follow‐up. A total of 889 people aged between 40 and 85 years have been enrolled. The estimated study completion date is November 2019. Authors' conclusions There is currently no high‐quality evidence for the effects of subconjunctival draining minimally‐invasive glaucoma devices for medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma. Properly designed RCTs are needed to assess the medium‐ and long‐term efficacy and safety of this technique. Plain language summary Devices that drain on to the surface of the eye beneath the surface layer to reduce eye pressure in people with or at risk of glaucoma What was the aim of the review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if devices draining from the front compartment of the eye (anterior chamber) onto the surface of the eye beneath the surface layer (subconjunctival space) known as minimally‐invasive glaucoma devices are effective in reducing the pressure in the eye in people with glaucoma that is not adequately controlled by drops. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found no completed studies and one ongoing study. Key messages  There are no relevant published studies comparing subconjunctival draining minimally‐invasive glaucoma devices with other treatments. What was studied in the review?  Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. In glaucoma, the optic nerve at the back of eye is damaged, in many cases because the pressure inside the eye is too high. Doctors can lower the eye pressure by surgery. Subconjunctival draining minimally‐invasive glaucoma devices could help make this surgery less traumatic, which may be safer than standard surgery and more comfortable for people with a quicker visual recovery period. What are the main results of the review?  The Cochrane Review authors did not find any completed studies that could be included in this review. How up‐to‐date is the review?

CD010572.PUB2,"Abstract - Background A range of surgical and non‐surgical techniques have received increasing attention in recent years in an effort to reduce the duration of a course of orthodontic treatment. Various surgical techniques have been used; however, uncertainty exists in relation to the effectiveness of these procedures and the possible adverse effects related to them. Objectives To assess the effects of surgically assisted orthodontics on the duration and outcome of orthodontic treatment. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 10 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 10 September 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 10 September 2014), LILACS via BIREME (1980 to 10 September 2014), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to 10 September 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 10 September 2014), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 10 September 2014). We checked the reference lists of all trials identified for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the electronic searches. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of surgical adjunctive procedures for accelerating tooth movement compared with conventional treatment (no surgical adjunctive procedure). Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the trials and extracted data. We used the fixed‐effect model and expressed results as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We investigated heterogeneity with reference to both clinical and methodological factors. Main results We included four RCTs involving a total of 57 participants ranging in age from 11 to 33 years. The interventions evaluated were corticotomies to facilitate orthodontic space closure or alignment of an ectopic maxillary canine, with the effect of repeated surgical procedures assessed in one of these studies. The studies did not report directly on the primary outcome as prespecified in our protocol: duration of orthodontic treatment, number of visits during active treatment (scheduled and unscheduled) and duration of visits. The main outcome assessed within the trials was the rate of tooth movement, with periodontal effects assessed in one trial and pain assessed in one trial. A maximum of just three trials with small sample sizes were available for each comparison and outcome. We assessed all of the studies as being at unclear risk of bias. Tooth movement was found to be slightly quicker with surgically assisted orthodontics in comparison with conventional treatment over periods of one month (MD 0.61 mm; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.72; P value < 0.001) and three months (MD 2.03 mm, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.54; P value < 0.001). Our results and conclusions should be interpreted with caution given the small number of included studies. Information on adverse events was sought; however, no data were reported in the included studies. Authors' conclusions This review found that there is limited research concerning the effectiveness of surgical interventions to accelerate orthodontic treatment, with no studies directly assessing our prespecified primary outcome. The available evidence is of low quality, which indicates that further research is likely to change the estimate of the effect. Based on measured outcomes in the short‐term, these procedures do appear to show promise as a means of accelerating tooth movement. It is therefore possible that these procedures may prove useful; however, further prospective research comprising assessment of the entirety of treatment with longer follow‐up is required to confirm any possible benefit. Plain language summary Surgical procedures for accelerating orthodontic treatment Review question  Orthodontic treatment (use of braces) is lengthy, typically taking over 18 months to complete, with brace adjustments required every six weeks or so. Usually brace treatment is carried out without the use of surgery. However, special surgical procedures have been proposed to speed up orthodontic treatment. This review, produced through the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines the merits and risks of surgical methods for speeding up orthodontic treatment compared to standard orthodontic treatment in adolescents and adults.  Background  Reduction of orthodontic treatment duration is highly desirable. Surgery has been advocated to speed up tooth movement and may work by stimulating cells adjacent to the teeth or by reducing the resistance presented by the supporting bone and mechanically shifting teeth. These procedures are relatively new and may carry additional risks compared to standard treatment.  Study characteristics  The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 10 September 2014. We found four relevant studies to include in this review. These studies involved 57 participants ranging in age from 11 to 33 years. All of the studies investigated the effects of surgical procedures on either the time taken to align a displaced tooth or to close gaps between teeth. None of these studies reported being funded by the orthodontic industry.  Key results  Slightly faster tooth movement was found with the surgical procedures, although this result is based on a relatively small number of participants. In addition, there were some problems inherent in the design and quality of all the studies. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm whether additional surgery is warranted to speed up tooth movement. The studies did not provide any information about negative side effects from the treatment.  Quality of the evidence  The quality of the evidence concerning the rate of tooth movement was judged to be low for assessments one month and three months after the procedure.",Surgical adjunctive procedures for accelerating orthodontic treatment,Fleming and  PS; Fedorowicz and  Z; Johal and  A; El‐Angbawi and  A; Pandis and  N,3,2,,
CD010663.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three‐dimensional deformity of the spine. While AIS can progress during growth and cause a surface deformity, it is usually not symptomatic. However, if the final spinal curvature surpasses a certain critical threshold, the risk of health problems and curve progression is increased. Interventions for the prevention of AIS progression include scoliosis‐specific exercises, bracing, and surgery. The main aims of all types of interventions are to correct the deformity and prevent further deterioration of the curve and to restore trunk asymmetry and balance, while minimising morbidity and pain, allowing return to full function. Surgery is normally recommended for curvatures exceeding 40 to 50 degrees to stop curvature progression with a view to achieving better truncal balance and cosmesis. Short‐term results of the surgical treatment of people with AIS demonstrate the ability of surgery to improve various outcome measures. However there is a clear paucity of information on long‐term follow‐up of surgical treatment of people with AIS. Objectives To examine the impact of surgical versus non‐surgical interventions in people with AIS who have severe curves of over 45 degrees, with a focus on trunk balance, progression of scoliosis, cosmetic issues, quality of life, disability, psychological issues, back pain, and adverse effects, at both the short term (a few months) and the long term (over 20 years). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, four other databases, and three trials registers up to August 2014 with no language limitations. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles and conducted an extensive handsearch of the grey literature. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective controlled trials comparing spinal fusion surgery with non‐surgical interventions in people with AIS with a Cobb angle greater than 45 degrees. We were interested in all types of instrumented surgical interventions with fusion that aimed to provide curve correction and spine stabilisation. Data collection and analysis We found no RCTs or prospective controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. Main results We did not identify any evidence comparing surgical to non‐surgical interventions for AIS with severe curves of over 45 degrees. Authors' conclusions We cannot draw any conclusions. Plain language summary Surgical treatment compared to non‐surgical treatment (braces, exercise, or observation) for teens with idiopathic scoliosis Background Scoliosis is a condition where the spine is curved in three dimensions (from the back the spine appears to be shaped like a 'c' or an 's'). It is often idiopathic, or of unknown cause. The most common type of scoliosis, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), is discovered around 10 years of age or older, and is defined as a curve that measures at least 10 degrees (known as a Cobb angle, which is measured on an x‐ray). People with AIS usually have no symptoms, however the resulting surface deformity frequently negatively impacts adolescents. In addition, increased curvature of the spine can present health risks in adulthood. Different types of treatment, including physical therapy, bracing, and surgery, are advocated depending on the magnitude of the curvature and area affected, truncal balance, general health, level of function and satisfaction, and patient’s and parent’s treatment desire. Surgery is normally recommended in curvatures exceeding 40 to 50 degrees to stop the progression of the curvature. Short‐term results of surgical treatment are improvements on outcome measures relating to self image, some functional aspects, and pain. However, the structured long‐term follow‐up needed to make meaningful conclusions is lacking. Recent papers highlight the long‐term complications of surgery, while other papers postulate that the medium‐ and long‐term complication rates following modern scoliosis surgery are low when compared to older techniques. Study characteristics We searched the literature for both randomised controlled trials and prospective non‐randomised studies with a control group examining the effects of surgical versus non‐surgical treatments for teens with idiopathic scoliosis. The evidence is current to August 2014. Key results We identified no evidence examining the effectiveness of surgical interventions compared to non‐surgical interventions for people with AIS. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of these treatments.",Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions in people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,Bettany‐Saltikov and  J; Weiss and  HR; Chockalingam and  N; Taranu and  R; Srinivas and  S; Hogg and  J; Whittaker and  V; Kalyan and  RV; Arnell and  T,3,1,,
CD003193.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Overactive bladder syndrome is defined as urgency with or without urgency incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Pharmacotherapy with anticholinergic drugs is often the first line medical therapy, either alone or as an adjunct to various non‐pharmacological therapies after conservative options such as reducing intake of caffeine drinks have been tried. Non‐pharmacologic therapies consist of bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback, behavioural modification, electrical stimulation and surgical interventions. Objectives To compare the effects of anticholinergic drugs with various non‐pharmacologic therapies for non‐neurogenic overactive bladder syndrome in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 4 September 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE, and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised, controlled trials of treatment with anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder syndrome or urgency urinary incontinence in adults in which at least one management arm involved a non‐drug therapy. Trials amongst patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors evaluated the trials for appropriateness for inclusion and risk of bias. Two authors were involved in the data extraction. Data extraction was based on predetermined criteria. Data analysis was based on standard statistical approaches used in Cochrane reviews. Main results Twenty three trials were included with a total of 3685 participants, one was a cross‐over trial and the other 22 were parallel group trials. The duration of follow up varied from two to 52 weeks. The trials were generally small and of poor methodological quality.  During treatment, symptomatic improvement was more common amongst those participants on anticholinergic drugs compared with bladder training in seven small trials (73/174, 42% versus 98/172, 57% not improved: risk ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.91). Augmentation of bladder training with anticholinergics was also associated with more improvements than bladder training alone in three small trials (23/85, 27% versus 37/79, 47% not improved: risk ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 0.88). However, it was less clear whether an anticholinergic combined with bladder training was better than the anticholinergic alone, in three trials (for example 74/296, 25% versus 95/306, 31% not improved: risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.04). The other information on whether combining behavioural modification strategies with an anticholinergic was better than the anticholinergic alone was scanty and inconclusive. Similarly, it was unclear whether these complex strategies alone were better than anticholinergics alone. In this review, seven small trials comparing an anticholinergic to various types of electrical stimulation modalities such as Intravaginal Electrical Stimulation (IES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), the Stoller Afferent Nerve Stimulation System (SANS) neuromodulation and percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) were identified. Subjective improvement rates tended to favour the electrical stimulation group in three small trials (54% not improved with the anticholinergic versus 28/86, 33% with electrical stimulation: risk ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.34). However, this was statistically significant only for one type of stimulation, percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (risk ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 4.33), and was not supported by significant differences in improvement, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, incontinence episodes or quality of life. The most commonly reported adverse effect among anticholinergics was dry mouth, although this did not necessarily result in withdrawal from treatment. For all comparisons there were too few data to compare symptoms or side effects after treatment had ended. However, it is unlikely that the effects of anticholinergics persist after stopping treatment.  Authors' conclusions The use of anticholinergic drugs in the management of overactive bladder syndrome is well established when compared to placebo treatment. During initial treatment of overactive bladder syndrome there was more symptomatic improvement when (a) anticholinergics were compared with bladder training alone, and (b) anticholinergics combined with bladder training were compared with bladder training alone. Limited evidence from small trials might suggest electrical stimulation is a better option in patients who are refractory to anticholinergic therapy, but more evidence comparing individual types of electrostimulation to the most effective types of anticholinergics is required to establish this. These results should be viewed with caution in view of the different classes and varying doses of individual anticholinergics used in this review. Anticholinergics had well recognised side effects, such as dry mouth. Plain language summary Anticholinergic drugs versus non‐drug active therapies for overactive bladder syndrome in adults without neurological problems Overactive bladder syndrome occurs in adults who have urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence (leakage of urine).  People usually empty their bladders frequently during the day and also at night (nocturia). It is a major problem affecting quality of life, in over 22 million people. It affects men and women, and is more common in women and in older people.  It is also expensive for both patients and the health service.  It is not clear exactly why it occurs, and there are many treatments including drugs and behavioural treatments such as bladder training and pelvic floor exercises.  It is not clear which treatments work best, have the fewest side effects and which are most economical.  Twenty three trials with 3685 participants were included in the review. Participants were more likely to improve if they were using an anticholinergic drug compared with bladder training alone, and also when using a combination of an anticholinergic drug plus bladder training.  More people reported an improvement in their overactive bladder symptoms when using electrical stimulation than an anticholinergic drug, but this was only significant in one trial for one type of electrical stimulation, percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation.  These results have to be viewed with caution as different types and doses of the anticholinergic drugs were used in the trials. The main adverse effect reported was dry mouth, in about a third of the people taking an anticholinergic drug.",Anticholinergic drugs versus non‐drug active therapies for non‐neurogenic overactive bladder syndrome in adults,Rai and  BP; Cody and  JD; Alhasso and  A; Stewart and  L,1,3,,
CD012019,"Abstract - Background About 10% of reproductive‐aged women suffer from endometriosis which is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the 'gold standard' diagnostic test for endometriosis, but it is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no simple non‐invasive or minimally‐invasive tests available in clinical practice that accurately diagnoses endometriosis. Objectives 1. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of urinary biomarkers for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. 2. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses. Urinary biomarkers were evaluated as replacement tests for surgical diagnosis and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis. Search methods The searches were not restricted to particular study design, language or publication dates. We searched the following databases to 20 April ‐ 31 July 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP and ClinicalTrials.gov (trial register). MEDION, DARE, and PubMed were also searched to identify reviews and guidelines as reference sources of potentially relevant studies. Recently published papers not yet indexed in the major databases were also sought. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstract, text words across the record and the medical subject headings (MeSH) and was modified for each database. Selection criteria Published peer‐reviewed, randomised controlled or cross‐sectional studies of any size were considered, which included prospectively collected samples from any population of reproductive‐aged women suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more urinary biomarkers with surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of the data from each study. For each diagnostic test, the data were classified as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. The bivariate model was used to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data sets were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful urine test to replace diagnostic surgery was one with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 79% to detect endometriosis. The criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity of equal or greater than 95% and specificity of equal or greater than 50%, which in case of negative result rules out the diagnosis (SnOUT test) or sensitivity of equal or greater than 50% with specificity of equal or greater than 95%, which in case of positive result rules the diagnosis in (SpIN test). Main results We included eight studies involving 646 participants, most of which were of poor methodological quality. The urinary biomarkers were evaluated either in a specific phase of menstrual cycle or irrespective of the cycle phase. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of four urinary biomarkers for endometriosis, including three biomarkers distinguishing women with and without endometriosis (enolase 1 (NNE); vitamin D binding protein (VDBP); and urinary peptide profiling); and one biomarker (cytokeratin 19 (CK 19)) showing no significant difference between the two groups. All of these biomarkers were assessed in small individual studies and could not be statistically evaluated in a meaningful way. None of the biomarkers met the criteria for a replacement test or a triage test. Three studies evaluated three biomarkers that did not differentiate women with endometriosis from disease‐free controls. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use as a replacement or triage test in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Several urinary biomarkers may have diagnostic potential, but require further evaluation before being introduced into routine clinical practice. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, and diagnosis of endometriosis using urinary biomarkers should only be undertaken in a research setting. Plain language summary Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis Review Question How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? Background Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. Study characteristics The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. Key results None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Quality of the evidence Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. Future research More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis.",Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis,Liu and  E; Nisenblat and  V; Farquhar and  C; Fraser and  I; Bossuyt and  PMM; Johnson and  N; Hull and  ML,3,2,,
CD003525.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Surgery is sometimes recommended for persistent lateral elbow pain where other less invasive interventions have failed. Objectives To determine the benefits and safety of surgery for lateral elbow pain. Search methods We searched CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science unrestricted by date or language (to 15 December 2010). Selection criteria Randomised and controlled clinical trials assessing a surgical intervention compared with no treatment or another intervention including an alternate surgical intervention, in adults with lateral elbow pain. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Main results We included five trials involving 191 participants with persistent symptoms of at least five months duration and failed conservative treatment. Three trials compared two different surgical procedures and two trials compared surgery to a non‐surgical treatment. All trials were highly susceptible to bias. Meta‐analysis was precluded due to differing comparator groups and outcome measures. One trial (24 participants) reported no difference between open extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) surgery and radiofrequency microtenotomy, although reanalysis found that pain was significantly lower in the latter group at three weeks (MD ‐2.80 points on 10 point scale, 95% CI ‐5.07 to ‐0.53). One trial (26 participants) reported no difference between open ECRB surgery and decompression of the posterior interosseous nerve in terms of the number of participants with improvement in pain pain on activity, or tenderness on palpation after an average of 31 months following surgery. One trial (45 participants) found that compared with open release of the ERCB muscle, percutaneous release resulted in slightly better function. One trial (40 participants) found comparable results between open surgical release of the ECRB and botulinum toxin injection at two years, although we could not extract any data for this review. One trial (56 participants) found that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) improved pain at night compared with percutaneous tenotomy at 12 months (MD 5 points on 100 point VAS, 95% CI 1.12 to 8.88), but there were no differences in pain at rest or pain on applying pressure. Authors' conclusions Due to a small number of studies, large heterogeneity in interventions across trials, small sample sizes and poor reporting of outcomes, there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of surgery for lateral elbow pain. Further well‐designed randomised controlled trials and development of standard outcome measures are needed. Plain language summary Surgery for elbow pain (tennis elbow) This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of surgery for lateral elbow pain, also known as tennis elbow. The review shows the following. In people with lateral elbow pain: ‐ percutaneous (smaller incision) surgery may slightly improve the ability to use your arm normally, compared with open surgery (in people who have had pain for a year or more and have failed to improve with non‐surgical treatments); ‐ radiofrequency microtenotomy applied to the affected tendon probably results in quicker pain improvement in the short term but results are the same in the long term when compared with open surgery; ‐ there was not enough information in the included studies to tell if surgery would make a difference in quality of life compared with not having surgery or compared with non‐surgical treatments. There was no information about side effects in the included studies. Side effects of surgery may include infection, nerve damage, or loss of ability to straighten the arm. What is lateral elbow pain and what is surgery? Lateral elbow pain, or tennis elbow, can occur for no reason or be caused by too much stress on the tendon at the elbow. It can cause the outside of the elbow (lateral epicondyle) and the upper forearm to become painful and tender to touch. Pain can last for six months to two years, and may get better on its own. Many treatments have been used to treat elbow pain but it is not clear whether these treatments work or if the pain simply goes away on its own. If the pain does not go away by itself or with various treatments like steroid injections or physiotherapy or both, surgery can be performed. Surgery on your elbow can include making a small cut in the arm and trimming damaged tissue from the tendon that joins the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) to the bone in the elbow (called an ECRB tenotomy), or releasing the tendon from the bone with a scalpel (called an ECRB release). The tenotomy may be done 'percutaneously', with a much smaller (1 cm) incision in the skin, or arthroscopically from within the joint. The ECRB tendon can also be detensioned further down in the mid‐forearm with a Z lengthening tenotomy. Another type of surgery that doesn't directly treat the ECRB tendon involves releasing the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) that might be being compressed by the muscle (PIN decompression). Best estimate of what happens to people with lateral elbow pain who have surgery Pain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):    ‐ people who had percutaneous (smaller incision) surgery with radio waves applied to the sore part of the elbow (radiofrequency microtenotomy) compared with open surgery (larger incision) rated their pain to be 3 points lower on a scale of 0 to 10 after 3 weeks (28% absolute improvement);  ‐ people who had percutaneous surgery rated their pain to be 3.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 after 3 weeks;  ‐ people who had open surgery rated their pain to be 6.5 on a scale of 0 to 10. Physical function and disabilty (higher scores mean worse physical function or more disability):    ‐ people who had percutaneous (smaller incision) surgery compared with open surgery (larger incision) rated their disability to be 4 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 after 12 months (4% absolute improvement);  ‐ people who had percutaneous surgery rated their disability to be 49 on a scale of 0 to 100;  ‐ people who had open surgery rated their disability to be 53 on a scale of 0 to 100.",Surgery for lateral elbow pain,Buchbinder and  R; Johnston and  RV; Barnsley and  L; Assendelft and  WJJ; Bell and  SN; Smidt and  N,1,3,,
CD006157.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The role of pre‐operative chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was not clear. A systematic review and quantitative meta‐analysis were therefore undertaken to evaluate the available evidence from randomised trials. Objectives To evaluate the effect of pre‐operative chemotherapy on survival in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer. If adequate data are available, to investigate whether or not pre‐defined patient subgroups benefit more or less from pre‐operative chemotherapy. Search methods MEDLINE and CANCERLIT searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were supplemented by information from trial registers and by handsearching relevant meeting proceedings and by discussion with relevant trialists and organisations. Selection criteria RCTs were eligible for inclusion provided the patients had been randomised between chemotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone and that the method of randomisation precluded prior knowledge of the treatment to be assigned. Data collection and analysis A systematic review and meta‐analysis based on aggregate data extracted from trial publications was carried out to assess the effectiveness of pre‐operative chemotherapy in NSCLC. This involved identifying eligible RCTs and extracting aggregate data from the abstracts or reports of these RCTs. Hazard ratios were calculated from published summary statistics and then combined to give pooled estimates of treatment efficacy. Main results Twelve eligible RCTs were identified. Data were available from seven RCTs including 988 patients (75% of eligible patients). Pre‐operative chemotherapy increased survival with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95%CI 0.69‐0.97) P = 0.022. This is equivalent to an absolute benefit of 6%, increasing overall survival across all stages of disease from 14% to 20% at 5 years. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.980, I 2  = 0). Authors' conclusions This analysis shows a significant increase in survival attributable to pre‐operative chemotherapy. This is currently the best estimate of the effectiveness of this therapy, but is based on a small number of trials and patients. This analysis was unable to address important questions such as whether particular types of patients may benefit more or less from pre‐operative chemotherapy or whether the early stopping of a number of included RCTs impacted on the results. These issues may be addressed by an ongoing individual patient data (IPD) meta‐analysis. Plain language summary The pre‐operative chemotherapy might increase survival in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer when compared to surgery alone The results of this systematic review suggest that pre‐operative chemotherapy might increase survival in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer when compared to surgery alone. However, an individual patient data systematic review and meta‐analysis is needed to give us a more reliable assessment of the size of benefits and to explore whether pre‐operative chemotherapy may be more or less effective for particular types of patients.",Chemotherapy and surgery versus surgery alone in non‐small cell lung cancer,Burdett and  S; Stewart and  L; Rydzewska and  L,2,3,,
CD011492.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Brain radionecrosis (tissue death caused by radiation) can occur following high‐dose radiotherapy to brain tissue and can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life (QoL) and function. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear for this condition, which makes establishing effective treatments challenging. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions used for the treatment of brain radionecrosis in adults over 18 years old. Search methods In October 2017, we searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) for eligible studies. We also searched unpublished data through Physicians Data Query,  www.controlled‐trials.com/rct ,  www.clinicaltrials.gov , and  www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials  for ongoing trials and handsearched relevant conference material. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention directed to treat brain radionecrosis in adults over 18 years old previously treated with radiation therapy to the brain. We anticipated a limited number of RCTs, so we also planned to include all comparative prospective intervention trials and quasi‐randomised trials of interventions for brain radionecrosis in adults as long as these studies had a comparison group that reflects the standard of care (i.e. placebo or corticosteroids). Selection bias was likely to be an issue in all the included non‐randomised studies therefore results are interpreted with caution. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (CC, PB) independently extracted data from selected studies and completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment. For dichotomous outcomes, the odds ratio (OR) for the outcome of interest was reported. For continuous outcomes, treatment effect was reported as mean difference (MD) between treatment arms with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results Two RCTs and one prospective non‐randomised study evaluating pharmacological interventions met the inclusion criteria for this review. As each study evaluated a different drug or intervention using different endpoints, a meta‐analysis was not possible. There were no trials of non‐pharmacological interventions that met the inclusion criteria. A very small randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of bevacizumab versus placebo reported that 100% (7/7) of participants on bevacizumab had reduction in brain oedema by at least 25% and reduction in post‐gadolinium enhancement, whereas all those receiving placebo had clinical or radiological worsening or both. This was an encouraging finding but due to the small sample size we did not report a relative effect. The authors also failed to provide adequate details regarding the randomisation and blinding procedures Therefore, the certainty of this evidence is low and a larger RCT adhering to reporting standards is needed. An open‐label RCT demonstrated a greater reduction in brain oedema (T2 hyperintensity) in the edaravone plus corticosteroid group than in the corticosteroid alone group (MD was 3.03 (95% CI 0.14 to 5.92; low‐certainty evidence due to high risk of bias and imprecision); although the result approached borderline significance, there was no evidence of any important difference in the reduction in post‐gadolinium enhancement between arms (MD = 0.47, 95% CI ‐ 0.80 to 1.74; low‐certainty evidence due to high risk of bias and imprecision). In the RCT of bevacizumab versus placebo, all seven participants receiving bevacizumab were reported to have neurological improvement, whereas five of seven participants on placebo had neurological worsening (very low‐certainty evidence due to small sample size and concerns over validity of analyses). While no adverse events were noted with placebo, three severe adverse events were noted with bevacizumab, which included aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolus and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. In the RCT of corticosteroids with or without edaravone, the participants who received the combination treatment were noted to have significantly greater clinical improvement than corticosteroids alone based on LENT/SOMA scale (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.01; low‐certainty evidence due to open‐label design). No differences in treatment toxicities were observed between arms. One included prospective non‐randomised study of alpha‐tocopherol (vitamin E) versus no active treatment was found but it did not include any radiological assessment. As only one included study was a double‐blinded randomised controlled trial, the other studies were prone to selection and detection biases. None of the included studies reported quality of life outcomes or adequately reported details about corticosteroid requirements. A limited number of prospective studies were identified but subsequently excluded as these studies had a limited number of participants evaluating different pharmacological interventions using variable endpoints. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of good certainty evidence to help quantify the risks and benefits of interventions for the treatment of brain radionecrosis after radiotherapy or radiosurgery. In an RCT of 14 patients, bevacizumab showed radiological response which was associated with minimal improvement in cognition or symptom severity. Although it was a randomised trial by design, the small sample size limits the quality of data. A trial of edaravone plus corticosteroids versus corticosteroids alone reported greater reduction in the surrounding oedema with combination treatment but no effect on the enhancing radionecrosis lesion. Due to the open‐label design and wide confidence intervals in the results, the quality of this data was also low. There was no evidence to support any non‐pharmacological interventions for the treatment of radionecrosis. Further prospective randomised studies of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions are needed to generate stronger evidence. Two ongoing RCTs, one evaluating bevacizumab and one evaluating hyperbaric oxygen therapy were identified. Plain language summary Interventions for the treatment of brain radionecrosis (radiation‐induced damage) after brain radiation treatment Background  When brain tissue dies due to a reaction to radiotherapy it is called  brain radionecrosis.  Brain radionecrosis can cause damage to the patient’s ability function. What this looks like depends where the radionecrosis has happened in the brain and it can impact on a patient’s quality of life. There are currently limited available treatments for brain radionecrosis. Patients are commonly given powerful anti‐inflammatory drugs (called corticosteroids) and some patients may require surgery to remove the area of brain that has radionecrosis. More effective treatments for this condition are needed. Study characteristics  In October 2017, we searched a list of literature databases and conference proceedings to identify studies that evaluated treatments for brain radionecrosis. A total of three studies were identified that evaluated drugs of which only two were RCTs and one of these RCTs had only 14 participants. No studies evaluating non‐drug treatments were identified. Key findings  The two drugs compared to corticosteroids alone in this review were bevacizumab (a drug affecting the blood vessels) and edaravone (a powerful antioxidant). A very small‐sized study reported that bevacizumab improved the appearance of the radionecrosis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This was associated with improvement in neurological symptoms than placebo but also with severe side effects. Edaravone in combination with corticosteroids improved the appearance of radionecrosis on MRI; this was associated with improvement in the reported symptoms using the LENT/SOMA scale. However, the patient and treating team were aware of the particular treatment the patient was receiving, so the reported symptoms may have been influenced by this. None of the included studies reported quality of life outcomes or adequately reported details about corticosteroid requirements. Finally a two arm non‐randomised study of vitamin E versus no active treatment based on patient preference reported improvement in learning and memory, but this study did not report any imaging response. The results may have been influenced as patients chose their study treatment thus introducing other potential biases. Certainty of the evidence  Based on the findings of this review the certainty of the available evidence is low/very low, which limits our ability to help determine the risks and benefits of the evaluated treatments for brain radionecrosis. The studies were at risk of bias due to aspects of their study designs and/or very limited number of participants. There is a great need for higher‐quality evidence with larger multi‐centre randomised control trials of treatments for brain radionecrosis. In our search of the literature for this review, two ongoing RCTs, one evaluating bevacizumab and one evaluating hyperbaric oxygen therapy were identified.",Interventions for the treatment of brain radionecrosis after radiotherapy or radiosurgery,Chung and  C; Bryant and  A; Brown and  PD,2,3,,
CD011650.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is classified in many ways. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group staging classifies the cancer based on patient's life expectancy. People with very early‐ or early‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma have single tumour or three tumours of maximum diameter of 3 cm or less, Child‐Pugh status A to B, and performance status 0 (fully functional). Management of hepatocellular carcinoma is uncertain. Objectives To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of early or very early hepatocellular carcinoma through a network meta‐analysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‐analysis and instead assessed the benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other or versus sham or no intervention using standard Cochrane methodology. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on hepatocellular carcinoma. Selection criteria We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with very early‐ or early‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, size and number of the tumours, and future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials including participants who were previously liver transplanted. We considered interventions compared with each other, sham, or no intervention. Data collection and analysis We calculated the odds ratio, mean difference, rate ratio, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models based on available‐participant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed the risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four trials (593 participants; 574 participants included for one or more analyses) compared surgery versus radiofrequency ablation in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, eligible to undergo surgery. Fourteen trials (2533 participants; 2494 participants included for various analyses) compared different non‐surgical interventions in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, not eligible to undergo surgery. Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes for both comparisons. Surgery versus radiofrequency ablation The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral aetiology. The trials did not report the participants' portal hypertension status or whether they received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. The average follow‐up ranged from 29 months to 42 months (3 trials). There was no evidence of a difference in all‐cause mortality at maximal follow‐up for surgery versus radiofrequency ablation (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.08; 574 participants; 4 trials; I 2  = 68). Cancer‐related mortality was lower in the surgery group (20/115 (17.4%)) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (43/115 (37.4%)) (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65; 230 participants; 1 trial). Serious adverse events (number of participants) was higher in the surgery group (14/60 (23.3%)) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (1/60 (1.7%)) (odds ratio 17.96, 95% CI 2.28 to 141.60; 120 participants; 1 trial). The number of serious adverse events was higher in the surgery group (adjusted rate 11.3 events per 100 participants) than in the radiofrequency ablation group (3/186 (1.6 events per 100 participants)) (rate ratio 7.02, 95% CI 2.29 to 21.46; 391 participants; 2 trials; I 2  = 0%). None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. One trial was funded by a party with vested interests; three trials were funded by parties without any vested. Non‐surgical interventions The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral aetiology. Most trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants, and none of the trials reported whether the participants received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. The average follow‐up ranged from 6 months to 37 months (11 trials). Trial participants, who were not eligible for surgery, were treated with radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation, microwave ablation, percutaneous acetic acid injection, percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of radiofrequency ablation with systemic chemotherapy, a combination of radiofrequency ablation with percutaneous alcohol injection, a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation with percutaneous alcohol injection, or a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation with radiofrequency ablation. The mortality at maximal follow‐up was higher in the percutaneous acetic acid injection (hazard ratio 1.77, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.79; 125 participants; 1 trial) and percutaneous alcohol injection (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.88; 882 participants; 5 trials; I 2  = 57%) groups compared with the radiofrequency ablation group. There was no evidence of a difference in all‐cause mortality at maximal follow‐up for any of the other comparisons. The proportion of people with cancer‐related mortality at maximal follow‐up was higher in the percutaneous alcohol injection group (adjusted proportion 16.8%) compared with the radiofrequency ablation group (20/232 (8.6%)) (odds ratio 2.18, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.89; 458 participants; 3 trials; I 2  = 0%). There was no evidence of a difference in any of the comparisons that reported serious adverse events (number of participants or number of events). None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. Five trials were funded by parties without any vested interest; the source of funding was not available in the remaining trials. Authors' conclusions The evidence was of low or very low quality. There was no evidence of a difference in all‐cause mortality at maximal follow‐up between surgery and radiofrequency ablation in people eligible for surgery. All‐cause mortality at maximal follow‐up was higher with percutaneous acetic acid injection and percutaneous alcohol injection than with radiofrequency ablation in people not eligible for surgery. There was no evidence of a difference in all‐cause mortality at maximal follow‐up for the other comparisons. High‐quality RCTs designed to assess clinically important differences in all‐cause mortality and health‐related quality of life, and having an adequate follow‐up period (approximately five years) are needed. Plain language summary Treatment of very early‐ or early‐stage primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) arises from the liver cells and is distinct from cancer arising from other parts of the body and spreading to the liver. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group staging classifies cancer based on patient's life expectancy. It is broadly based on the size of the cancer, number of cancers in the liver, how well the liver functions, and whether one's activities are affected by the cancer. People with very early‐ or early‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma have single cancer or multiple small cancers confined to the liver, have good liver function, and no restriction of activities. There is significant uncertainty in the management of early‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we searched literature databases for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on the topic until September 2016. We excluded trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time, we planned to use advanced methods described in full in the review. Study characteristics of included trials Four trials (593 participants; 574 participants included for one or more analyses) compared surgery (removal of part of the liver containing cancer) versus radiofrequency ablation (cancer destruction using heat generated by electric current) in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, eligible to undergo surgery; and 14 trials (2533 participants; 2494 participants included for various analyses) compared different non‐surgical interventions in people with early hepatocellular carcinoma, not eligible to undergo surgery. Key results Surgery versus radiofrequency ablation The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral cause. The trials did not report the participants' portal hypertension status or whether they received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy. Three trials reported average follow‐up (range 29 months to 42 months). One trial was funded by a party with vested interests; three trials were funded by parties without any vested.. In people eligible for surgery, there was no evidence of a difference in death between radiofrequency ablation and surgery; although there were fewer deaths due to cancer in the surgery group. There were more serious complications in the the surgery group than in the radiofrequency ablation group. None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. Non‐surgical interventions The majority of participants had cirrhotic livers, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was of viral cause. Most trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants, and none reported whether the participants received adjuvant antiviral treatment or adjuvant immunotherapy.

CD011923.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Pilonidal sinus disease is a common condition that mainly affects young adults. This condition can cause significant pain and impairment of normal activities. No consensus currently exists on the optimum treatment for pilonidal sinus and current therapies have various advantages and disadvantages. Fibrin glue has emerged as a potential treatment as both monotherapy and an adjunct to surgery. Objectives To assess the effects of fibrin glue alone or in combination with surgery compared with surgery alone in the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease. Search methods In December 2016 we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase and CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and conference proceedings for ongoing and unpublished studies and scanned reference lists to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies involving participants of all ages and studies conducted in any setting. We considered studies involving people with both new and recurrent pilonidal sinus. We included studies which evaluated fibrin glue monotherapy or as an adjunct to surgery. Data collection and analysis Two study authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Main results We included four RCTs with 253 participants, all were at risk of bias. One unpublished study evaluated fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure, two studies evaluated fibrin glue as an adjunct to Limberg flap and one study evaluated fibrin glue as an adjunct to Karydakis flap. For fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure, there were no data available for the primary outcomes of time to healing and adverse events. There was low‐quality evidence of less pain on day one after the procedure with fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure (mean difference (MD) ‐2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.03 to ‐0.97) (evidence downgraded twice for risk of performance and detection bias). Fibrin glue may reduce the time taken to return to normal activities compared with Bascom's procedure (mean time 42 days with surgery and 7 days with glue, MD ‐34.80 days, 95% CI ‐66.82 days to ‐2.78 days) (very low‐quality evidence, downgraded as above and for imprecision). Fibrin glue as an adjunct to the Limberg flap may reduce the healing time from 22 to 8 days compared with the Limberg flap alone (MD ‐13.95 days, 95% CI ‐16.76 days to ‐11.14 days) (very low‐quality evidence, downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias and imprecision). It is uncertain whether use of fibrin glue affects the incidence of postoperative seroma (an adverse event) (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.61; very low‐quality evidence, downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias and imprecision). There was low‐quality evidence that fibrin glue, as an adjunct to Limberg flap, may reduce postoperative pain (median 2 versus 4; P < 0.001) and time to return to normal activities (median 8 days versus 17 days; P < 0.001). The addition of fibrin glue to the Limberg flap may reduce the length of hospital stay (MD ‐1.69 days, 95% CI ‐2.08 days to ‐1.29 days) (very low‐quality evidence, downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias and for unexplained heterogeneity). A single RCT evaluating fibrin glue as an adjunct to the Karydakis flap did not report data for the primary outcome of time to healing. It is uncertain whether fibrin glue with the Karydakis flap affects the incidence of postoperative seroma (adverse event) (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 13.46) (very low‐quality evidence, downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias and for imprecision). Fibrin glue as an adjunct to Karydakis flap may reduce length of stay but this is highly uncertain (mean 2 days versus 3.7 days; P < 0.001, low‐quality evidence downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias). Authors' conclusions Current evidence is uncertain regarding any benefits associated with fibrin glue either as monotherapy or as an adjunct to surgery for people with pilonidal sinus disease. We identified only four RCTs and each was small and at risk of bias resulting in very low‐quality evidence for the primary outcomes of time to healing and adverse events. Future studies should enrol many more participants, ensure adequate randomisation and blinding, whilst measuring clinically relevant outcomes. Plain language summary Fibrin glue for pilonidal sinus disease Review question We reviewed the evidence regarding the effectiveness of fibrin glue, used on its own or with surgery, in the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease. Background Pilonidal sinus disease is a common condition mainly affecting young adults. The condition develops following an infection in the groove between the buttocks. The infection can cause fluid collections or a sinus (a channel under the skin) to form. Young men are more likely to be affected, and other risk factors include obesity, poor hygiene and prolonged sitting. Extensive body hair is also a factor as ingrowing hair follicles are thought to make the condition worse. The condition causes pain and often requires time off work. This affects patients’ quality of life and may cause loss of earnings. Pilonidal sinus disease is normally treated with a small operation. Fibrin glue, a naturally‐occurring glue‐like gel, can also be used as an alternative to, or in addition to surgery. We looked for evidence as to whether fibrin glue can speed up the healing time for this type of wound. We also wanted to find out if the treatment affected other outcomes such as pain, infection and return of the pilonidal sinus following the procedure, and whether it had any side effects (fluid collections or allergic reactions). Study characteristics In December 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials involving participants of any age or sex, whose pilonidal sinus had been treated with fibrin glue, either on its own or with surgery. We found four studies that included 253 participants, the majority of whom were male. Fibrin glue on its own was compared with surgery in one study. In three studies fibrin glue was applied during surgery and compared with surgery on its own. There were problems with the design and conduct of all four studies which mean that their results are very uncertain. Key results It is not known whether fibrin glue on its own affects time to healing and adverse events compared with a type of surgery (Bascom's procedure). Fibrin glue may result in less pain on the first day after the procedure compared with Bascom's procedure. When fibrin glue is used alongside a type of surgery called the Limberg flap it may reduce the healing time by approximately 14 days compared with the surgery on its own, however this finding is highly uncertain as the evidence is very low‐quality. It is uncertain whether using the fibrin glue alongside the Limberg flap affects the incidence of a complication called seroma (a collection of fluid) but it may reduce postoperative pain (this evidence is low‐quality and therefore quite uncertain) and may reduce time to return to normal activities (low‐quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (this was very low‐quality evidence and therefore very uncertain). One study evaluated the effect of adding fibrin glue to a type of surgery called the Karydakis flap. It is not clear from this study whether using the glue affects time to healing or the incidence of seroma. Using the fibrin glue with the Karydakis flap may reduce length of hospital stay compared with surgery alone but again this is low‐quality evidence. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence for all outcomes was low or very low, mainly due to problems with the ways the studies were conducted and also the uncertainty in the results because of the small numbers of participants in the studies. This means we cannot be confident of the effects of fibrin glue on any of these outcomes and more, better quality and larger studies are required.

CD009648.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Many surgical approaches are available to treat varicose veins secondary to chronic venous insufficiency. One of the least invasive techniques is the ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency method (in French 'cure conservatrice et hémodynamique de l'insuffisance veineuse en ambulatoire' (CHIVA)), an approach based on venous hemodynamics with deliberate preservation of the superficial venous system. This is the second update of the review first published in 2013. Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of the CHIVA method with alternative therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 19 October 2020. We also searched PUBMED to 19 October 2020 and checked the references of relevant articles to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CHIVA to other therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed and selected studies, extracted data, and performed quantitative analysis from the selected papers. A third author solved any disagreements. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), number of people needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), and the number of people needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The main outcomes of interest were the recurrence of varicose veins and side effects. Main results For this update, we identified two new additional studies. In total, we included six RCTs with 1160 participants (62% women) and collected from them eight comparisons. Three RCTs compared CHIVA with vein stripping. One RCT compared CHIVA with compression dressings in people with venous ulcers. The new studies included three comparisons, one compared CHIVA with vein stripping and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and one compared CHIVA with vein stripping and endovenous laser therapy. We judged the certainty of the evidence for our outcomes as low to very low due to inconsistency, imprecision caused by the low number of events and risk of bias. The overall risk of bias across studies was high because neither participants nor personnel were blinded to the interventions. Two studies attempted to blind outcome assessors, but the characteristics of the surgery limited concealment. Five studies reported the outcome clinical recurrence of varicose veins with a follow‐up of 18 months to 10 years. CHIVA may make little or no difference to the recurrence of varicose veins in the lower limb compared to stripping (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 5 studies, 966 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether CHIVA reduced recurrence compared to compression dressing (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.96; 1 study, 47 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to clinical recurrence compared to RFA (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.74 to 5.53; 1 study, 146 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and endovenous laser (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; 1 study, 100 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found no clear difference between CHIVA and stripping for the side effects of limb infection (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 studies, 746 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and superficial vein thrombosis (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.17; 4 studies, 846 participants; low‐certainty evidence). CHIVA may reduce slightly nerve injury (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98; NNTH 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; 4 studies, 846 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and hematoma compared to stripping (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.97; NNTH 11, 95% CI 5 to 100; 2 studies, 245 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For bruising, one study found no differences between groups while another study found reduced rates of bruising in the CHIVA group compared to the stripping group. Compared to RFA, CHIVA may make little or no difference to rates of limb infection, superficial vein thrombosis, nerve injury or hematoma, but may cause more bruising (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28; NNTH 8, CI 95% 5 to 25; 1 study, 144 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Compared to endovenous laser, CHIVA may make little or no difference to rates of limb infection, superficial vein thrombosis, nerve injury or hematoma. The study comparing CHIVA versus compression did not report side effects. Authors' conclusions There may be little or no difference in the recurrence of varicose veins when comparing CHIVA to stripping (low‐certainty evidence), but CHIVA may slightly reduce nerve injury and hematoma in the lower limb (low‐certainty evidence). Very limited evidence means we are uncertain of any differences in recurrence when comparing CHIVA with compression (very low‐certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to recurrence compared to RFA (low‐certainty evidence), but may result in more bruising (low‐certainty evidence). CHIVA may make little or no difference to recurrence and side effects compared to endovenous laser therapy (low‐certainty evidence). However, we based these conclusions on a small number of trials with a high risk of bias as the effects of surgery could not be concealed, and the results were imprecise due to the low number of events. New RCTs are needed to confirm these results and to compare CHIVA with approaches other than open surgery. Plain language summary CHIVA method for the treatment of varicose veins Background Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a disorder in which veins fail to pump blood back to the heart adequately. As a result, it can cause varicose veins, skin ulcers, and superficial or deep vein thrombosis in the legs, and symptoms such as pain, fatigue, heaviness, warmth and swelling of the leg. The ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency (CHIVA) method is a minimally invasive surgical technique to treat varicose veins. The CHIVA treatment aims to eliminate venous‐venous shunts (abnormal connections between veins) by disconnecting the escape points, preserving the saphenous vein (a vein from the top of the foot to the upper thigh area) and normal venous drainage of the limb's superficial tissues. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? First, we searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical studies where people are randomly put into one or more treatment groups. This type of study provides the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorized the evidence as very low, low, moderate or high certainty. What did we find? We found six RCTs that included 1160 participants who had CVI. Three RCTs compared the CHIVA method with vein stripping, one RCT compared the CHIVA method with compression dressings in people with venous ulcers. The newly included studies included three comparisons, one compared CHIVA with vein stripping (where a vein is removed or tied off) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA; which destroys the nerve fibres carrying pain signals to the brain), and one compared CHIVA with vein stripping and endovenous laser therapy (where veins are heated by a laser). The results showed that the CHIVA method may make little or no difference to the recurrence of varicose veins and may reduce slightly nerve injury and bruising in the lower limb compared to stripping. The CHIVA method showed similar numbers of limb infection and superficial vein thrombosis (inflammation and clotting in a vein) as vein stripping. Compared to RFA, CHIVA may make little or no difference to rates of limb infection, superficial vein thrombosis, nerve injury or hematoma (a severe bruise within the soft tissues), but may cause more bruising. Compared to endovenous laser, CHIVA may make little or no difference to recurrence and numbers of side effects. How reliable is the evidence? Further studies are needed to confirm these conclusions since they are based on a small number of clinical trials with methodological limitations such as a high risk of bias. In addition, participants and outcome assessors were not blinded to what treatments groups were given, and the results were imprecise due to the low number of events. How up to date is this review?

CD013261.PUB2,"Abstract - Background A glioblastoma is a fatal type of brain tumour for which the standard of care is maximum surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy, when possible. Age is an important consideration in this disease, as older age is associated with shorter survival and a higher risk of treatment‐related toxicity. Objectives To determine the most effective and best‐tolerated approaches for the treatment of elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. To summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs and cost‐effectiveness associated with these approaches. Search methods We searched electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to 3 April 2019, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to database closure. We handsearched clinical trial registries and selected neuro‐oncology society conference proceedings from the past five years. Selection criteria Randomised trials (RCTs) of treatments for glioblastoma in elderly people. We defined ‘elderly' as 70+ years but included studies defining ‘elderly' as over 65+ years if so reported. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods for study selection and data extraction. Where sufficient data were available, treatment options were compared in a network meta‐analysis (NMA) using Stata software (version 15.1). For outcomes with insufficient data for NMA, pairwise meta‐analysis were conducted in RevMan. The GRADE approach was used to grade the evidence. Main results We included 12 RCTs involving approximately 1818 participants. Six were conducted exclusively among elderly people (either defined as 65 years or older or 70 years or older) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the other six reported data for an elderly subgroup among a broader age range of participants. Most participants were capable of self‐care. Study quality was commonly undermined by lack of outcome assessor blinding and attrition. NMA was only possible for overall survival; other analyses were pair‐wise meta‐analyses or narrative syntheses. Seven trials contributed to the NMA for overall survival, with interventions including supportive care only (one trial arm); hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT40; four trial arms); standard radiotherapy (RT60; five trial arms); temozolomide (TMZ; three trial arms); chemoradiotherapy (CRT; three trial arms); bevacizumab with chemoradiotherapy (BEV_CRT; one trial arm); and bevacizumab with radiotherapy (BEV_RT). Compared with supportive care only, NMA evidence suggested that all treatments apart from BEV_RT prolonged survival to some extent. Overall survival High‐certainty evidence shows that CRT prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with RT40 (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.80) and low‐certainty evidence suggests that CRT may prolong overall survival compared with TMZ (TMZ versus CRT: HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.98). Low‐certainty evidence also suggests that adding BEV to CRT may make little or no difference (BEV_CRT versus CRT: HR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.48 to 1.44). We could not compare the survival effects of CRT with different radiotherapy fractionation schedules (60 Gy/30 fractions and 40 Gy/15 fractions) due to a lack of data. When treatments were ranked according to their effects on OS, CRT ranked higher than TMZ, RT and supportive care only, with the latter ranked last. BEV plus RT was the only treatment for which there was no clear benefit in OS over supportive care only.   One trial comparing tumour treating fields (TTF) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (TTF_AC) with adjuvant chemotherapy alone could not be included in the NMA as participants were randomised after receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy, not before. Findings from the trial suggest that the intervention probably improves overall survival in this selected patient population. We were unable to perform NMA for other outcomes due to insufficient data. Pairwise analyses were conducted for the following. Quality of life Moderate‐certainty narrative evidence suggests that overall, there may be little difference in QoL between TMZ and RT, except for discomfort from communication deficits, which are probably more common with RT (1 study, 306 participants, P = 0.002). Data on QoL for other comparisons were sparse, partly due to high dropout rates, and the certainty of the evidence tended to be low or very low. Progression‐free survival High‐certainty evidence shows that CRT increases time to disease progression compared with RT40 (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.61); moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that RT60 probably increases time to disease progression compared with supportive care only (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.46), and that BEV_RT probably increases time to disease progression compared with RT40 alone (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.78). Evidence for other treatment comparisons was of low‐ or very low‐certainty. Severe adverse events Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that TMZ probably increases the risk of grade 3+ thromboembolic events compared with RT60 (risk ratio (RR) 2.74, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.94; participants = 373; studies = 1) and also the risk of grade 3+ neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Moderate‐certainty evidence also suggests that CRT probably increases the risk of grade 3+ neutropenia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia compared with hypofractionated RT alone. Adding BEV to CRT probably increases the risk of thromboembolism (RR 16.63, 95% CI 1.00 to 275.42; moderate‐certainty evidence). Economic evidence There is a paucity of economic evidence regarding the management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the elderly. Only one economic evaluation on two short course radiotherapy regimen (25 Gy versus 40 Gy) was identified and its findings were considered unreliable. Authors' conclusions For elderly people with glioblastoma who are self‐caring, evidence suggests that CRT prolongs survival compared with RT and may prolong overall survival compared with TMZ alone. For those undergoing RT or TMZ therapy, there is probably little difference in QoL overall. Systemic anti‐cancer treatments TMZ and BEV carry a higher risk of severe haematological and thromboembolic events and CRT is probably associated with a higher risk of these events. Current evidence provides little justification for using BEV in elderly patients outside a clinical trial setting. Whilst the novel TTF device appears promising, evidence on QoL and tolerability is needed in an elderly population. QoL and economic assessments of CRT versus TMZ and RT are needed. More high‐quality economic evaluations are needed, in which a broader scope of costs (both direct and indirect) and outcomes should be included. Plain language summary Treatment options for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in older people What is the issue?  Glioblastoma is a fatal type of brain tumour. The standard treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is to remove as much of the tumour as possible by operation, and then to give chemotherapy (an anti‐cancer medicine called temozolomide (TMZ)) and radiotherapy. TMZ is usually given at the same time as radiotherapy (concomitant chemotherapy), and also for about six months after radiotherapy (adjuvant chemotherapy). Together, these treatments can be called chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, not all people, particularly the elderly, are fit enough to receive CRT, which can have serious side‐effects. In this review we evaluated evidence on different treatments that have been looked at in older people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, to find out which treatments may help. How we conducted the review  We searched for trials that compared different treatments in elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and also for studies on cost‐effectiveness. We defined 'the elderly' as 70+ years, but also included data from patients 65+ years old if studies did not give results for the 70+ age group. We used standard Cochrane methods to assess studies and collect data. We compared treatments in a network meta‐analysis (NMA), which allowed us to rank different treatments options. What we found  We found 12 studies evaluating different options including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, supportive (palliative) care, combinations of treatments, and a medical device that is worn on the head and emits an electric field (known as tumour treating fields). Most people enrolled in these studies did not have serious disabilities. In the NMA, we compared the effects of seven treatments on patients overall survival. All treatments tested in the NMA apart from one, in which an agent called bevacizumab (BEV) was combined with radiotherapy, clearly prolonged survival compared with supportive care only. The strongest evidence we found showed that CRT leads to a longer survival time than short‐course radiotherapy only; but weaker evidence suggested that CRT also prolongs survival compared with TMZ only. When we ranked all treatments according to their effectiveness in prolonging survival time, CRT ranked higher than TMZ, RT and supportive care only, with the latter ranked last. A study of tumour treating fields could not be included in the NMA because it was conducted among fitter elderly patients who had already received part of their CRT. Evidence from this study suggested that adding tumour treating fields after radiotherapy probably improves survival in this fitter group of patients. With regard to quality of life, evidence suggested that the impact of TMZ and radiotherapy‐only treatments is probably not very different, except for greater discomfort from communication deficits with radiotherapy. Quality of life evidence was hard to interpret for other treatment options because it tended to be limited by high dropout rates, as people with glioblastoma do not live very long and may not feel like filling out questionnaires when they feel unwell.

CD003285.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Elevated plasma levels of the amino acid homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinaemia) are associated with narrowing or blocking of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Treatment to lower homocysteine levels has been shown to be both effective and cheap in healthy volunteers. However, the impact of reducing homocysteine levels on the progression of atherosclerosis and patency of the vessels after treatment for atherosclerosis is still unknown and forms the basis for this review. This is the second update of a review first published in 2002. Objectives To assess the effects of plasma homocysteine lowering therapy on the clinical progression of disease in people with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and hyperhomocysteinaemia including, as a subset, those who have undergone surgical or radiological intervention. Search methods For this update, the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Disease Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2013) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12). Trial databases were searched by the TSC (January 2013) for details of ongoing and unpublished studies. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised trials in which participants with PAD and hyperhomocysteinaemia were allocated to either homocysteine lowering therapy or no treatment, including participants before and after surgical or radiological interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Information on adverse events was collected from the trials. Main results Two randomised trials with a total of 161 participants were included in this review. The studies did not report on mortality and rate of limb loss. One randomised trial with a total of 133 participants showed that there was a significant improvement in ankle brachial index (ABI) in participants who received folic acid compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.11, P < 0.001) and in participants who received 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate (5‐MTHF) versus placebo (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10, P = 0.009). A second trial with a total of 18 participants showed that there was no difference (P non‐significant) in ABI in participants who received a multivitamin B supplement (mean ± SEM: 0.7 ± 01) compared with placebo (mean ± SEM: 0.8 ± 0.1). No major events were reported. Authors' conclusions Currently, no recommendation can be made regarding the value of treatment of hyperhomocysteinaemia in peripheral arterial disease. Further, well constructed trials are urgently required. Plain language summary Homocysteine lowering interventions for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and bypass grafts Homocysteine is one of the amino acids, the building blocks for proteins. High levels of homocysteine in the blood are associated with narrowing or blocking of arteries (atherosclerosis). However, it is not clear that the homocysteine itself causes the problem. Blood levels of homocysteine can be normalised by taking folic acid, vitamins B12 and B6, or betaine. People with PAD have poor blood flow in their legs caused by atherosclerosis narrowing or blocking their arteries. Symptoms include a limited ability to exercise or walk without developing cramping pains in the legs. Although such people can be treated surgically (such as by a bypass graft) or radiologically (by balloon angioplasty), there is an appreciable risk of failure of the treatment within 12 months, mainly because the arteries narrow and close up again (restenosis). High levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinaemia) may contribute to this restenosis and lowering homocysteine levels may help. We looked at studies where treatments to lower homocysteine were used in people with PAD and hyperhomocysteinaemia. Two trials with 161 participants with PAD were included in this review. One trial showed a significant  improvement in the ankle brachial index (ABI) in participants treated daily with 400 μg folic acid or 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate (5‐MTHF). A second trial showed that there was no difference in ABI in participants who received a multivitamin B supplement compared with placebo. None of the other predefined primary outcomes (mortality and rate of limb loss) were assessed in these studies. More research about the effect of homocysteine lowering therapy on the clinical progression of disease in people with PAD and hyperhomocysteinaemia is needed.",Homocysteine lowering interventions for peripheral arterial disease and bypass grafts,Andras and  A; Stansby and  G; Hansrani and  M,2,3,,
CD009894.PUB3,"Abstract - Background The success of digital replantation is highly dependent on the patency of the repaired vessels after microvascular anastomosis. Antithrombotic agents are frequently used for preventing vascular occlusion. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been reported to be as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH) in peripheral vascular surgery, but with fewer adverse effects. Its benefit in microvascular surgery such as digital replantation is unclear. This is an update of the review first published in 2013. Objectives To assess if treatment with subcutaneous LMWH improves the salvage rate of the digits in patients with digital replantation after traumatic amputation. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers, to 17 March 2020. The authors searched PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Chinese Electronic Periodical Services (CEPS) on 17 March 2020 and sought additional trials from reference lists of relevant publications. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing treatment with LMWH versus any other treatment in participants who received digital replantation following traumatic digital amputation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (PL, CC) independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included two new randomised trials in this update, bringing the total number of included trials to four. They included a total of 258 participants, with at least 273 digits, from hospitals in China. Three studies compared LMWH versus UFH, and one compared LMWH versus no LMWH. The mean age of participants ranged from 24.5 to 37.6 years. In the studies reporting the sex of participants, there were a total of 145 men and 59 women. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded to low or very low because all studies were at high risk of performance or reporting bias (or both) and there was imprecision in the results due to the small numbers of participants. The three studies comparing LMWH versus UFH reported the success rate of replantation using different units of analysis (participant or digit), so we were unable to combine data from all three studies (one study reported results for both participants and digits). No evidence of a benefit in success of replantation was seen in the LMWH group when compared with UFH, regardless of whether the outcomes were reported by number of participants (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.10; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence); or by number of digits (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 200 digits, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported the incidence of compromised microcirculation requiring surgical or non‐surgical therapy, or any systemic/other causes of microvascular insufficiency. There was no evidence of a clear difference between the LMWH and UFH groups in occurrence of arterial occlusion (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10; 54 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence) or venous occlusion (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.27; 54 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies reported adverse effects. The LMWH and UFH groups showed no evidence of a difference in wound bleeding (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.23; 130 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence), haematuria (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.11; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), ecchymoses (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.19; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), epistaxis (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.32; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), gingival bleeding (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.43; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence), and faecal occult blood (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31; 130 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). We could not pool data on coagulation abnormalities as varying definitions and tests were used in the three studies. One study compared LMWH versus no LMWH. The success rate of replantation, when analysed by digits, was reported as 91.2% success in the LMWH group and 82.1% in the control group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.33; 73 digits, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Compromised microcirculation requiring surgical re‐exploration, analysed by digits, was 11.8% in the LMWH group and 17.9% in the control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.58; 73 digits, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Compromised microcirculation requiring incision occurred in five out of 34 digits (14.7%) in the LMWH group and eight out of 39 digits (20.5%) in the control group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.98; 73 digits; very low‐certainty evidence). Microvascular insufficiency due to arterial occlusion, analysed by digits, was 11.8% in the LMWH group and 17.9% in the control group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.05; 73 digits, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence), and venous occlusion was 14.7% in the LMWH group and 20.5% in the control (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.98; 73 digits, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report complications or adverse effects. Authors' conclusions There is currently low to very low‐certainty evidence, based on four RCTs, suggesting no evidence of a benefit from LMWH when compared to UFH on the success rates of replantation or affect microvascular insufficiency due to vessel occlusion (analysed by digit or participant). LMWH had similar success rates of replantation; and the incidence rate of venous and arterial microvascular insufficiency showed no evidence of a difference between groups when LMWH was compared to no LMWH (analysed by digit). Similar rates of complications and adverse effects were seen between UFH and LMWH. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on any effect on coagulation when comparing LMWH to UFH or no LMWH. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded due to performance and reporting bias, as well as imprecision in the results. Further adequately powered studies are warranted to provide high‐certainty evidence. Plain language summary Low molecular weight heparin for preventing blockage of blood vessels in replanted fingers or toes after amputation injuries Background Microvascular surgery refers to any surgery involving small‐sized blood vessels that is performed under the operating microscope, allowing, for example, for the repair of arteries and veins of amputated parts to the body. These vessels are typically 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter. Replantation is the reattachment of a completely detached body part, with fingers and thumbs being the most commonly replanted body parts. This is often referred to as digital replantation. In principle, digital replantation involves not only restoring the blood flow through the arteries and veins but also restoring the bony skeleton of the toes, fingers or thumbs, along with repairing the tendons and nerves, if necessary. Occlusion (blockage) of one or more of the repaired vessels due to the formation of a clot within the blood vessel can result in failure of the replantation. Anticoagulant medications are used to reduce clotting, and they could potentially prevent such a complication. Anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) have therefore been used to prevent clot formation after digital replantation. It is unclear if low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has similar benefit. Key results A randomised controlled trial (RCT) is a clinical study in which people have an equal chance of receiving the treatment or a comparator. This systematic review identified four RCTs comparing LMWH with either UFH or no LMWH. The trials included a total of 258 people with at least 273 replanted fingers or toes (digits). The evidence is up‐to‐date to 17 March 2020. The trials differed in which results they reported and how they reported them, so we could not combine all the information. Three trials showed no evidence of a benefit of LMWH when compared with UFH in the success rate of replantation, microvascular insufficiency due to vessel occlusion (poor blood flow due to blockages in the small‐sized blood vessels), and side effects such as bleeding. There was no evidence of clear differences between the use of LMWH or no LWMH in the success rate of replantation in one study. Similarly, no evidence of clear differences in the incidence of reduced blood flow (compromised microcirculation) requiring further microvascular surgery (re‐exploration or incision), or causes of microvascular insufficiency due to vessel blockage, were detected in the study which analysed by digits or people. The limited evidence, which we judged to be of low to very low certainty, suggests there is no clear benefit of LMWH in increasing the success rate of replantation or preventing microvascular occlusion in digital replantation when compared to UFH or no LMWH. Certainty of the evidence The overall certainty of evidence is very low due to limitations in study design and reporting. For example, the studies did not take measures to hide from a person which treatment they had, and they reported results that were not stated in the original plan. The sample size of included studies was not large enough to provide precise effect estimates. There is a need for large studies that are designed to reduce these study limitations.",Low molecular weight heparin for prevention of microvascular occlusion in digital replantation,Lin and  PT; Wang and  SH; Chi and  CC,2,3,,
CD010716.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Unilateral ureteric‐pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the most common cause of obstructive uropathy and may lead to renal impairment and loss of renal function. The current diagnostic approach with renal imaging cannot reliably determine which newborns and infants less than two years of age have a significant obstruction and are at risk for permanent kidney damage. There is therefore no consensus on optimal therapeutic management of unilateral UPJO. Objectives To assess the effects of surgical versus non‐surgical treatment options for newborns and infants less than two years of age with unilateral UPJO. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 6, 2016) ,  MEDLINE/Ovid, and EMBASE/Ovid databases from their inception to 13 June 2016. We searched the reference lists of potentially relevant studies without using any language restriction. We also searched the following trial registers for relevant registered studies:  www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ; ISRCTN registry ( controlled‐trials.com/ );  www.trialscentral.org/ ;  apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ;  www.drks.de/ ; and  www.anzctr.org.au/trialSearch.aspx . Selection criteria We selected randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with non‐surgical interventions for the treatment of unilateral UPJO. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. In case of disagreements we consulted a third review author. The data reported in the two included studies did not allow us to perform a meta‐analysis. Main results We found only two studies at high risk of bias that were eligible for inclusion in this review. The total sample size, including both trials, was small (n = 107 participants less than six months of age from the UK and USA), and not all prespecified outcome measures were assessed. Reported measures only accounted for the short‐term follow‐ups. The mean split renal function was not statistically different between the surgical and non‐surgical group at the six‐month or one‐year time point (very low‐quality evidence). The surgical group showed a significantly less obstructed drainage pattern and a lower urinary tract dilatation than the non‐surgical group (very low‐quality evidence). Transfer from the non‐surgical group to the surgical group was reported for about one out of five participants. Split renal function after secondary surgical intervention was reported with variable results, but most of the participants reverted to pre‐deteriorated values. The studies either provided no or insufficient data on the following outcome measures: postoperative complications, UPJO‐associated clinical symptoms, costs of interventions, radiation exposure, quality of life, and adverse effects. Authors' conclusions We found limited evidence assessing the benefits and harms of surgical compared to non‐surgical treatment options for newborns and infants less than two years of age with unilateral UPJO. The majority of participants in the non‐surgical treatment group did not experience any significant deterioration of split renal function, and only about 20% of them underwent secondary surgical intervention, with minor risk of permanent deteriorated split renal function. The study follow‐up period was too short to assess the long‐term effects on split renal function in both treatment groups. We need further randomised controlled trials with sufficient statistical power and an adequate follow‐up period to determine the optimal therapy for newborns and infants less than two years of age with unilateral UPJO. Plain language summary Surgery versus non‐surgical management for unilateral ureteric‐pelvic junction obstruction in newborns and infants less than two years of age Review question Do children with unilateral ureteric‐pelvic junction obstruction do better with or without surgery? Background Some newborn and infants less than two years of age are shown using ultrasound to have an enlargement of the pelvis of the kidney. This is the anatomical structure where the urine collects before it is transported down the ureter to the bladder. Enlargement of the pelvis of the kidney is a concern due to possible blockage of urine flow, not unlike how a river widens in front of a dam. Longer‐term blockage of the urine flow for months and years may damage the kidney and lead to other problems such as urinary tract infections or kidney stones. Surgery can remove a blockage if it occurs, but it also has downsides including risks of complications. It is unclear whether these operations are necessary. Results We searched for studies up to 13 June 2016 and found two trials that compared groups of newborns and infants less than two years of age, including a total of 107 children who had surgery or no surgery and were followed for up to five years. Based on very low‐quality evidence, we found that short‐term kidney function (after six and 12 months) was similar in the two groups. Very low‐quality evidence also showed that after surgery, the pelvis of the kidney was smaller and urine seemed to flow better from the kidney down the ureter. However, due to the methods and size and of the studies, we are very uncertain about these results. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether one group of participants did better longer term, had fewer complications, or had better quality of life.",Surgery versus non‐surgical management for unilateral ureteric‐pelvic junction obstruction in newborns and infants less than two years of age,Weitz and  M; Portz and  S; Laube and  GF; Meerpohl and  JJ; Bassler and  D,3,1,,
CD001081.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long‐term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke, but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of a Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2017. Objectives To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone, in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non‐disabling stroke). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal to October 2019. We also reviewed the reference lists of all relevant studies and abstract books from research proceedings. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carotid artery surgery plus best medical treatment with best medical treatment alone.  Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. We assessed the results and the quality of the evidence of the primary and secondary outcomes by the GRADE method, which classifies the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. Main results We included three trials involving 6343 participants. The trials differed in the methods of measuring carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke. Using the primary electronic data files, we pooled and analysed individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient‐years of follow‐up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials, and redefining outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. Surgery increased the five‐year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with less than 30% stenosis (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.56; 2 studies, 1746 participants; high‐quality evidence). Surgery decreased the five‐year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19; 2 studies, 1429 participants; high‐quality evidence), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94; 3 studies, 1549 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near‐occlusion (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.67; 3 studies, 1095 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). However, surgery decreased the five‐year risk of any stroke or operative death in participants with near‐occlusions (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.53; 2 studies, 271 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of recurrent stroke for people with significant stenosis. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate‐quality evidence) and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis (moderate‐quality evidence). Plain language summary Carotid surgery in people who have symptoms with narrowing of the carotid artery Question What are the benefits of surgical removal of the fatty deposits and blood clots from inside the carotid artery wall (carotid endarterectomy) for people who have recently (within four to six months) had symptoms due to carotid stenosis (narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to the brain)? Background Strokes cause long‐term disability and death. The chances of dying from the first stroke are 15% to 35%, and increase to 69% in subsequent strokes, which often occur within one year of the first attack. Carotid endarterectomy may reduce the risk of subsequent or recurrent stroke, but carries a risk of complications immediately before, after, and during the operation, including disabling stroke and death. There is a 7% risk of stroke and death within 30 days of endarterectomy. Search date We searched for studies to 23 October 2019. Study characteristics This review identified three randomised controlled trials (6343 participants randomised), which compared carotid surgery with no carotid surgery (i.e. best medical therapy plus surgery versus best medical therapy alone) in participants with carotid stenosis and recent transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), or minor ischaemic strokes in the territory of that artery. The trials were carried out in centres in Europe, USA, Canada, Israel, South Africa, and Australia. The gender ratio of participants was 2.6:1 (72% men and 28% women); 90% of participants were younger than 75 years old. The results of the three trials were initially conflicting, because they differed in how they measured carotid stenosis and how they defined the outcomes. To address this discrepancy, we reassessed the original patient data using the same methods and definitions, so results could be compared. Key results Carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of further stroke for people with significant stenosis. Results were particularly striking for older people, male participants, those with a significant stenosis (70% to 99%), and those who were operated on within two weeks of their TIA or stroke. Endarterectomy might be of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% stenosis. We did not find any benefit of carotid surgery for those in whom the stenosis was minor (less than 50%) or where the carotid artery was almost blocked (near occlusion). Quality of the evidence The evidence was of moderate or high quality for all the results. Therefore, we can be moderately or very confident in the results.",Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis,Rerkasem and  A; Orrapin and  S; Howard and  DPJ; Rerkasem and  K,3,2,,
CD010244.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer. Resection of the cancer is the only treatment with the potential to achieve long‐term survival. However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving adjacent structures such as blood vessels which are not usually removed because of fear of increased complications after surgery. Such patients often receive palliative treatment. Resection of the pancreas along with the involved vessels is an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus palliative treatment in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trial registers until February 2014. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing pancreatic resection versus palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (irrespective of language or publication status). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed‐effect and random‐effects models using Review Manager (RevMan). We calculated the hazard ratio (HR), risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on an intention‐to‐treat analysis. Main results We identified two trials comparing pancreatic resection versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Ninety eight patients were randomised to pancreatic resection (n = 47) or palliative treatment (n = 51) in the two trials included in this review. Both trials were at high risk of bias. Both trials included patients who had locally advanced pancreatic cancer which involved the serosa anteriorly or retroperitoneum posteriorly or involved the blood vessels. Such pancreatic cancers would be considered generally unresectable. One trial included patients with pancreatic cancer in different locations of the pancreas including the head, neck and body (n = 42). The patients allocated to the pancreatic resection group underwent partial pancreatic resection (pancreatoduodenectomy with lymph node clearance or distal pancreatic resection with lymph node clearance) in this trial; the control group received palliative treatment with chemoradiotherapy. In the other trial, only patients with cancer in the head or neck of the pancreas were included (n = 56). The patients allocated to the pancreatic resection group underwent en bloc total pancreatectomy with splenectomy and vascular reconstruction in this trial; the control group underwent palliative bypass surgery with chemoimmunotherapy. The pancreatic resection group had lower mortality than the palliative treatment group (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58, very low quality evidence). Both trials followed the survivors up to at least five years. There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group in either trial. Approximately 40% of the patients who underwent pancreatic resection were alive in the pancreatic resection group at the end of three years. This difference in survival was statistically significant (RR 22.68; 95% CI 3.15 to 163.22). The difference persisted at five years of follow‐up (RR 8.65; 95% CI 1.12 to 66.89). Neither trial reported severe adverse events but it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from severe adverse events in both groups. The overall peri‐operative mortality in the resection group in the two trials was 2.5%. None of the trials reported quality of life. The estimated difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of the patient related to the treatment) between the two groups was imprecise (MD ‐23.00 days; 95% CI ‐59.05 to 13.05, very low quality evidence). The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the pancreatic resection group than the palliative treatment group (MD ‐10.70 thousand USD; 95% CI ‐14.11 to ‐7.29, very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is very low quality evidence that pancreatic resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and venous involvement. When sufficient expertise is available, pancreatic resection could be considered for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased morbidity associated with the procedure. Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to increase confidence in the estimate of effect and to assess the quality of life of patients and the cost‐effectiveness of pancreatic resection versus palliative treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Plain language summary Surgical removal of part of the pancreas and other tissues versus other treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer which invades the surrounding structures Background The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen which secretes digestive juices for the digestion of food. It also harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain the blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer. Surgery to remove the cancer improves survival. However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving major blood vessels which are not usually removed because of the fear of increased complications after surgery. Such patients receive palliative treatment. Resection (removing part of an organ) of the pancreas has been suggested as an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, in this group of patients the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus other treatments are not clear. We set out to answer this question by performing a thorough search of the literature for studies which compared surgical removal with palliative treatments. We included only randomised controlled trials, studies which, if designed appropriately, can help avoid arriving at wrong conclusions. We searched the literature for all studies reported until December 2013. Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data to minimise errors. Characteristics of studies We identified two trials comparing surgical removal of the pancreas versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Ninety eight patients were included in these two trials. Forty seven patients received surgery while the remaining patients received palliative treatment. The choice of who received surgery and who received other treatments was decided by a method similar to the toss of a fair coin. Main results Approximately 97% of patients who underwent cancer removal surgery survived the surgery in the two trials. The patients who received surgery were twice as likely to live as those who received other treatments. The survivors were followed until at least five years. There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group while approximately 40% of the patients who underwent surgical removal were alive at the end of three years. This difference in survival was statistically significant. The studies did not report the complications related to surgery although it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from complications in both groups. None of the trials reported quality of life. There was no evidence of any difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of a patient related to the treatment) between the two groups. The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the surgical removal group (by about USD 10,000) than in the palliative treatment group in the trial conducted in Japan. There was no information about the costs in the other trial, which was conducted in Greece. Quality of evidence Overall, the trials were at high risk of bias (that is, there is a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions). This was because it was not clear how the randomisation was performed, whether the people assessing the outcomes were aware of the group to which the participants belonged, and whether all participants were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was very low as the trials were at high risk of bias and there were few trials to assess whether only studies with negative results were published. Conclusions There is very low quality evidence that surgical resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with involvement of veins. In selected patients pancreatic resection could be considered for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased complications associated with the surgical procedure and when sufficient expertise is available. Future research Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to obtain more precise results and to assess the quality of life of patients and the value for money of surgical removal versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.",Resection versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer,Gurusamy and  KS; Kumar and  S; Davidson and  BR; Fusai and  G,3,3,,
CD001004.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome(OSAHS) is the periodic reduction or cessation of airflow during sleep. The syndrome is associated with loud snoring, disrupted sleep and observed apnoeas. Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome aims to alleviate symptoms of daytime sleepiness, improve quality of life, and reduce the signs of sleep apnoea recorded by polysomnography. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any type of surgery for the treatment of the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field, research dissemination bodies and other Cochrane Review Groups. Searches were current as of July 2008. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing any surgical intervention for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome with other surgical or non‐surgical interventions or no intervention. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers assessed electronic literature search results for possibly relevant studies. Characteristics and data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted and entered into RevMan 5. Main results Twelve studies (709 participants) of mixed risk of bias met the inclusion criteria. Data from ten studies were eligible for assessment in the review. The participants recruited to the studies had mixed levels of AHI, but tended to suffer from moderate daytime sleepiness where this was measured. No data could be pooled.  Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) versus conservative management (one trial) : An un‐validated symptom score showed intermittent significant differences over a 12‐month follow‐up period. No differences in Polysomnography (PSG) outcomes were reported.  Laser‐assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) versus conservative management/placebo (two trials) : One study recruited a mixed population and separate data could not be obtained for this trial. In the other study no significant differences in Epworth scores or quality of life reported. A significant difference in favour of LAUP was reported in terms of apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and frequency and intensity of snoring.  Palatal implants versus placebo (one trial):  Symptoms and AHI were lower with palatal implants.  LAUP versus bipolar radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (one trial) : Within‐treatment group differences were significant for symptoms and AHI, but the between treatment group differences were not available to assess whether indirect inferences could be made regarding the effects of either treatment.  UPPP versus oral appliance (OA) (one trial) : AHI was significantly lower with OA therapy than with UPPP. No significant differences were observed in quality of life.  UPPP versus lateral pharyngoplasty (lateral PP) (one trial) : No significant difference in Epworth scores, but a greater reduction in AHI with lateral PP was reported.  Expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty (one trial):  Both interventions reduced AHI although statistical analysis on the difference between treatments was not reported.  Tongue advancement (mandibular osteotomy) + PPP versus tongue suspension + PPP (one trial) : There was a significant reduction in symptoms in both groups, but no significant difference between the two surgery types. Complications reported with all surgical techniques included nasal regurgitation, pain and bleeding. These did not persist in the long term. An additional study assessed the effects of four different techniques. No data were available on between group comparisons.  Multilevel temperature‐controlled radiofrequency tissue ablation (TCRFTA) versus sham placebo and CPAP (one trial):  There was an improvement in primary and secondary outcomes of TCRFTA over sham placebo and but no difference in symptomatic improvement when compared with CPAP.  Radiofrequency assisted uvulopalatoplasty technique versus channeling technique (one trial):  Dysphagia scores were lower in the channeling group immediately post‐operation, but at four months the difference was no longer significant. Snoring scores did not differ at long‐term follow‐up. The number of participants achieving AHI lower than 10 at four months was slightly higher with RAUP than channeling technique. Authors' conclusions There are now a small number of trials assessing different surgical techniques with inactive and active control treatments. The studies assembled in the review have failed to demonstrate consistent effects in favour of surgery and do not provide convincing evidence to support its use in sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Short‐term outcomes are unlikely to consistently identify suitable candidates for surgery. Long‐term follow‐up of patients who undergo surgical correction of upper airway obstruction is required. This would help to determine whether surgery is a curative intervention, or whether there is a tendency for the signs and symptoms of sleep apnoea to re‐assert themselves, prompting patients to seek further treatment for sleep apnoea. Plain language summary Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome aims to relieve obstruction by increasing the size of the airway in the throat, bypassing the airway or removing a lesion. A limited number of trials assessing diverse surgical techniques were identified. There were inconsistent effects reported across the trials. The available evidence from these small studies does not currently support the widespread use of surgery in people with mild to moderate daytime sleepiness associated with sleep apnoea.",Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea in adults,Sundaram and  S; Lim and  J; Lasserson and  TJ,2,3,,
CD012432.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Medication‐related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some individuals to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab and antiangiogenic agents) and involves the progressive destruction of bone in the mandible or maxilla. Depending on the drug, its dosage, and the duration of exposure, the occurrence of this adverse drug reaction may be rare (e.g. following the oral administration of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatments for osteoporosis, or antiangiogenic agent‐targeted cancer treatment) or common (e.g. following intravenous bisphosphonate for cancer treatment). MRONJ is associated with significant morbidity, adversely affects quality of life (QoL), and is challenging to treat. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs. To assess the effects of non‐surgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health’s Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (to 23 November 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 23 November 2016), and Embase Ovid (23 May 2016 to 23 November 2016). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry ( ClinicalTrials.gov ) and the  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform  were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on language or publication status when searching the electronic databases; however, the search of Embase was restricted to the last six months due to the Cochrane Embase Project to identify all clinical trials and add them to CENTRAL. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time‐to‐event, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included five RCTs (1218 participants) in the review. Three trials focused on the prophylaxis of MRONJ. Two trials investigated options for the treatment of established MRONJ. The RCTs included only participants treated with bisphosphonates and, thus, did not cover the entire spectrum of medications associated with MRONJ. Prophylaxis of MRONJ One trial compared standard care with regular dental examinations in three‐month intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ: RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39 (253 participants; low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated. As dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ, one trial investigated the effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) for preventing MRONJ in people with cancer undergoing dental extractions. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of PRGF on MRONJ incidence when compared with standard treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51; 176 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported. In another trial comparing wound closure by primary intention with wound closure by secondary intention after dental extractions in people treated with oral bisphosphonates (700 participants), no cases of intraoperative complications or postoperative MRONJ were observed. QoL was not investigated. Treatment of MRONJ One trial analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone. HBO in addition to standard care did not significantly improve healing from MRONJ compared with standard care alone (at last follow‐up: RR 1.56; 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18; 46 participants included in the analysis; very low‐quality evidence). QoL data were presented qualitatively as intragroup comparisons; hence, an effect estimate of treatment on QoL was not possible. Other secondary outcomes were not reported. The other RCT found no significant difference between autofluorescence‐ and tetracycline fluorescence‐guided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ at any timepoint (at one‐year follow‐up: RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; 34 participants included in the analysis; very low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported. Authors' conclusions Prophylaxis of MRONJ One open‐label RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations in three‐month intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of MRONJ in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low. There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of either of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ (i.e. PRGF inserted into the postextraction alveolus during dental extractions, and wound closure by primary or secondary intention after dental extractions). Treatment of MRONJ Available evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit for hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an adjunct to conventional therapy. There is also insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about autofluorescence‐guided versus tetracycline fluorescence‐guided bone surgery. Plain language summary Interventions for managing medication‐related osteonecrosis (severe bone damage) of the jaw Review question What are the effects of different interventions to either prevent or treat medication‐related osteonecrosis of the jaw compared with each other or compared with no treatment or an inactive intervention ('placebo')? Background Medication‐related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is severe bone damage in the jaw bone that occurs in some people as an adverse reaction to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile). It is a painful condition that can be difficult to treat. MRONJ occurs rarely in people taking some medicines for osteoporosis. However, in people receiving these drugs at higher doses for cancer‐related conditions, the risk of MRONJ may be higher and has been reported to occur in up to 5 in 100 individuals. It is essential to obtain better treatments for people who have MRONJ. It is also important to identify effective preventive measures to reduce the risk of MRONJ. Study characteristics Working with  Cochrane Oral Health , we searched for studies that had been published up to November 2016. We found three studies that focused on the prevention of MRONJ and two studies that tested treatments for MRONJ. The studies involved 1218 adults, with the smallest study having 40 participants and the largest study having 700 participants. Most study participants were women, but one study was of men with prostate cancer receiving bisphosphonate infusions (given by drip into a vein). All studies included only participants treated with bisphosphonates (used to support treatment and reduce risk of fracture and bone pain), although several other drugs are also known to induce MRONJ. Key results One study provided low‐quality evidence that dental examinations at three‐month intervals and preventive treatments (antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) are more effective than standard care for reducing the number of cases with MRONJ in a group of people receiving intravenous bisphosphonates for cancer‐related conditions. In the experimental group (which received preventive care consisting of antibiotics and specific wound closure), fewer people developed MRONJ (2 participants per 100 who underwent close monitoring) compared with the control group (23 participants per 100 who had standard care). There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the use of the other interventions investigated would reduce the risk of MRONJ or would improve healing of MRONJ. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was low or very low. This was due to limitations in how the studies were designed and run. For example, some participants changed groups during the study, some participants did not finish the study, and the outcomes were measured at different follow‐up times.",Interventions for managing medication‐related osteonecrosis of the jaw,Beth‐Tasdogan and  NH; Mayer and  B; Hussein and  H; Zolk and  O,3,2,,
CD008832.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Fractures of the shaft of the humerus account for 1% to 3% of all fractures in adults. The management of these fractures, including surgical intervention, varies widely. Objectives To assess and compare the effects of surgical versus non‐surgical intervention for non‐pathological fractures of the humeral shaft in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, trial registers, and bibliographies of trial reports. The full search was conducted in October 2011. Selection criteria Considered for inclusion were all randomised and quasi‐randomised (method of allocating participants to a treatment which is not strictly random; e.g. by date of birth, hospital record number or alternation) controlled trials that compared surgical with non‐surgical intervention for humeral shaft fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected and assessed potential eligible studies for inclusion. Main results We found six completed studies that appeared to meet our inclusion criteria. After scrutiny, we excluded all six studies: five were retrospective studies and one was a prospective study without randomisation. We identified three potentially eligible ongoing studies, two of which involve randomisation of treatment allocation and one, which we excluded, that does not. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence available from randomised controlled trials to ascertain whether surgical intervention of humeral shaft fractures gives a better or worse outcome than no surgery. Sufficiently powered good quality multi‐centre randomised controlled trials comparing surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating humeral shaft fractures in adults are needed. It is likely that the results from the two ongoing randomised trials on this topic will help inform practice in due course. Plain language summary Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating humeral shaft fractures in adults The humerus is the long bone of the upper arm. It extends from the shoulder to the elbow. The incidence of fractures of the middle part (shaft) of the humerus increases with age. Patients with this fracture can often be treated without surgery. Only a few patients need surgery. This review aimed to examine the evidence from best quality (randomised controlled) trials that compared surgical with non‐surgical treatment of humeral fractures to determine if either treatment gives a better outcome. Despite an extensive search for evidence, the review authors found no evidence from completed randomised controlled trials to help inform the choice between surgical and non‐surgical treatment.",Surgical versus non‐surgical interventions for treating humeral shaft fractures in adults,Gosler and  MW; Testroote and  M; Morrenhof and  JW; Janzing and  HMJ,3,1,,
CD010260.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Cervical cancer is the second commonest cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. Sources suggest that a very high proportion of new cervical cancer cases in developing countries are at an advanced stage (IB2 or more) and more than a half of these may be stage III or IV. Cervical cancer staging is based on findings from clinical examination (FIGO) staging). Standard care in Europe and US for stage IB2 to III is non‐surgical treatment (chemoradiation). However in developing countries, where there is limited access to radiotherapy, locally advanced cervical cancer may be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and hysterectomy (surgery to remove the womb and the neck of the womb, with or without the surrounding tissues). It is not certain if this improves survival. Therefore, it is important to systematically assess the value of hysterectomy in addition to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both, as an alternative intervention in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IB2 to III). Objectives To determine whether hysterectomy, in addition to standard treatment with radiation or chemotherapy, or both, in women with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IB2 to III) is safe and effective compared with standard treatment alone. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS up to February 2014. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment protocols involving hysterectomy versus radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both, in women with advanced stage (IB2 to III) cervical cancer presenting for the first time. Data collection and analysis We assessed study eligibility independently, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, overall and progression or disease‐free survival outcomes were synthesised in a meta‐analysis using the random‐effects model. Adverse events were incompletely reported so results of single trials were described in narrative form. Main results We included seven RCTs (1217 women) of varying methodological quality in the review; most trials were at moderate or high risk of bias. Three were multi‐centre trials, two were single‐centre trials, and in two trials it was unclear if they were single or multi‐centre. These trials compared the following interventions for women with locally advanced cervical cancer (stages IB2 to III): hysterectomy (simple or radical) with radiotherapy (N = 194) versus radiotherapy alone (N = 180); hysterectomy (simple or radical) with chemoradiotherapy (N = 31) versus chemoradiotherapy alone (N = 30); hysterectomy (radical) with chemoradiotherapy (N = 111) versus internal radiotherapy with chemoradiotherapy (N = 100); hysterectomy (simple or radical) with upfront (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy (N = 298) versus radiotherapy alone (N = 273). One trial (N = 256) found no difference in the risk of death or disease progression between women who received attenuated radiotherapy followed by hysterectomy and those who received radiotherapy (external and internal) alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.29). This trial also reported no difference between the two groups in terms of adverse effects (18/129 grade 3 or 4 adverse effects in the hysterectomy and radiation group and 19 cases in 18/121 women in the radiotherapy alone group). There was no difference in 5‐year tumour‐free actuarial survival (representation of the probable years of survivorship of a defined population of participants) or severe complications (grade 3) in another trial (N = 118) which reported the same comparison (6/62 versus 6/56 in the radiation with surgery group versus the radiotherapy alone group, respectively). The quality of the evidence was low for all these outcomes. One trial (N = 61) reported no difference (P value > 0.10) in overall and recurrence‐free survival at 3 years between chemoradiotherapy and hysterectomy versus chemoradiotherapy alone (low quality evidence). Adverse events and morbidity data were not reported. Similarly, another trial (N = 211) found no difference in the risk of death (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.21, P value = 0.19, low quality evidence), disease progression (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.34, P value = 0.24, low quality evidence) or severe late complications (P value = 0.53, low quality evidence) between women who received internal radiotherapy versus hysterectomy after both groups had received external‐beam chemoradiotherapy. Meta analysis of three trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone, assessing 571 participants, found that women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus hysterectomy had less risk of death than those who received radiotherapy alone (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93, I 2  = 0%, moderate quality evidence). However, a significant number of the participants that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus hysterectomy had radiotherapy as well. There was no difference in the proportion of women with disease progression or recurrence between the two groups (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.05, I 2  = 20%, moderate quality evidence). Results of single trials reported no apparent (P value > 0.05) difference in long‐term severe complications, grade 3 acute toxicity and severe late toxicity between the two groups (low quality evidence). Quality of life outcomes were not reported in any of the trials. Authors' conclusions From the available RCTs, we found insufficient evidence that hysterectomy with radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, improves the survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer who are treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. The overall quality of the evidence was variable across the different outcomes and was universally downgraded due to concerns about risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone for survival outcomes was moderate, with evidence from other comparisons of low quality. This was mainly based on poor reporting and sparseness of data where results were based on single trials. More trials that assess medical management with and without hysterectomy may test the robustness of the findings of this review as further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. Plain language summary Hysterectomy with medical management for cervical cancer that has spread to nearby tissues only The issue    Cancer of the neck of the womb (cervical cancer) is the commonest cancer among women up to 65 years of age. A high proportion of women in developing countries are diagnosed with locally advanced disease (spread to nearby tissues, but no obvious distant spread). They are usually treated with radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy (medical treatment). Hysterectomy (surgery to remove the womb and the cervix) with medical treatment is also used, especially in developing countries where access to radiotherapy is limited. The aim of the review    Is hysterectomy with medical treatment more beneficial compared to medical treatment alone in locally advanced cervical cancer? How was the review conducted?    A  literature search from 1966 to February 2014 identified seven trials at moderate to high risk of bias. These included 1217 women and compared: hysterectomy with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone; hysterectomy with chemoradiotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy alone; hysterectomy with chemoradiotherapy versus internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) with chemoradiotherapy; and hysterectomy with upfront (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. What are the main findings?    Two studies, including 374 women, compared preoperative radiotherapy and hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone, but only one trial reported overall survival, with no difference between the groups. These studies found no difference in the risk of disease progression (or death) or five‐year tumour‐free survival. One study, including 61 women, reported no difference in overall and recurrence‐free survival between chemotherapy and hysterectomy versus chemoradiotherapy alone. Another study comparing internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) versus hysterectomy in 211 women who received chemoradiotherapy found no difference in the risk of death or disease progression. By combining results from three of the independent studies that assessed 571 women, we found that fewer women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus hysterectomy died than those who received radiotherapy alone. However, many women in the first group also had radiotherapy. There was no difference in the number of women who were disease‐free after treatment. Adverse events were incompletely reported. Results of single trials showed no differences in severe adverse events between the two groups in any comparison. Limited data suggested that the interventions appeared to be reasonably well tolerated, although more evidence is needed. Quality of life measures were not reported. What are the conclusions?    We found insufficient evidence that hysterectomy added to radiation and chemoradiation improved survival, quality of life or adverse events in locally advanced cervical cancer compared with medical treatment alone. Overall, the quality of the evidence was variable and was universally downgraded due to concerns about risk of bias. The quality of the evidence for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone for survival outcomes was moderate, with evidence from other comparisons being of low quality.

CD010517.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of β‐thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life‐long blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018). Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio‐frequency). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Main results One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post‐operative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low‐quality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra‐operative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low‐quality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post‐operative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03). Authors' conclusions The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well‐conducted observational studies may be used to answer this question. Plain language summary Removal of the spleen in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia Review question We reviewed the evidence comparing the removal of the spleen (splenectomy) to other treatments (such as blood transfusions and chelation (removal of excess iron) in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia. Background Thalassaemia is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in production of haemoglobin ‐ which carries oxygen in red blood cells to all the tissues of the body. The clinical presentation of thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form to being dependant on life long blood transfusions. The genetic defect in thalassaemia also results in formation of ineffective red blood cells, which are removed by the spleen which in turn becomes enlarged. Removing the spleen can lengthen the lifespan of red blood cells and reduce the need for transfusions. We wanted to evaluate whether current evidence showed that removing the spleen was safe and effective in the long term and compare different surgical methods of removing the spleen. Search date The evidence is current to: 02 August 2019. Study characteristics One study with a total of 28 participant was included in the review. This study compared two methods of splenectomy ‐ laparoscopic (keyhole) versus an open surgical approach. Study participants were recruited over a period of 3.5 years, but participants were only followed up to the end of their hospital stay (usually less than one week). Key results The study evaluated the two types of surgical methods. Only one of our three primary outcomes were reported, the number of people experiencing major adverse events (bleeding during and after the operation and complete or partial collapse of a lung). However, the amount of information available is not sufficient to draw any reliable conclusions (very‐low quality evidence). Hence, we were unable to provide recommendations regarding the use of splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Appropriate clinical judgement, in view of the various risks and benefits described by other lower quality sources of evidence (e.g. observational studies), may be necessary when considering splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Quality of the evidence While we are satisfied that the participants had equal chances of undergoing either type of surgery, there is not enough information on other aspects of the study to make any overall judgement on its quality.",Splenectomy for people with thalassaemia major or intermedia,Sharma and  A; Easow Mathew and  M; Puri and  L,3,3,,
CD004198.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Sickle cell disease comprises a group of genetic haemoglobin disorders. The predominant symptom associated with sickle cell disease is pain resulting from the occlusion of small blood vessels by abnormally 'sickle‐shaped' red blood cells. There are other complications, including chronic organ damage and prolonged painful erection of the penis, known as priapism. Severity of sickle cell disease is variable, and treatment is usually symptomatic. Priapism affects up to half of all men with sickle cell disease, however, there is no consistency in treatment. We therefore need to know the best way of treating this complication in order to offer an effective interventional approach to all affected individuals. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched trial registries. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 09 September 2019. Date of most recent search of trial registries and of Embase: 01 October 2019. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing non‐surgical or surgical treatment with placebo or no treatment, or with another intervention for stuttering or fulminant priapism. Data collection and analysis The authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the trials. Main results Three trials with 102 participants were identified and met the criteria for inclusion in this review. These trials compared stilboestrol to placebo, sildenafil to placebo and a four‐arm trial which compared ephedrine or etilefrine to placebo and ranged in duration from two weeks to six months. All of the trials were conducted in an outpatient setting in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK. None of the trials measured our first primary outcome, detumescence. However, all three trials reported on the reduction in frequency of stuttering priapism, our second primary outcome; and from the evidence included in this review, we are uncertain whether stilboestrol, etilefrine or ephedrine reduce the frequency of stuttering priapism as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Additionally, we conclude that sildenafil may make little or no difference (low‐certainty evidence). Two trials reported on immediate side effects and we are uncertain whether etilefrine or ephedrine reduce the occurrence of these (very low‐certainty of evidence) and also conclude that sildenafil may make little or no difference in side effects (low‐quality evidence). Given that all of the trials were at risk of bias and all had low participant numbers, we considered the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of evidence for the benefits or risks of the different treatments for both stuttering and fulminant priapism in sickle cell disease. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for well‐designed, adequately‐powered, multicentre randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions for priapism in sickle cell disease. Plain language summary Treatments for long‐lasting and painful erection of the penis in boys and men with sickle cell disease Review question What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease? Background Priapism (the prolonged painful erection of the penis) is common in males with sickle cell disease. The length of time priapism lasts differs for different types and so does the medical treatment for it. Self‐management approaches may be helpful. We looked for randomised controlled trials of different treatments to find the best option. Search date We last looked for evidence on 09 September 2019. Study characteristics We found three trials set in Jamaica, Nigeria and the UK involving 102 people. Key results In the trials, four different drug treatments (stilboestrol, sildenafil, ephedrine and etilefrine) were compared to placebo. The trials all looked at whether the treatments reduced how often attacks of priapism occurred. There was no difference between any of the treatments compared to placebo. Due to lack of high‐quality evidence, we are not able to conclude the best treatment of priapism in sickle cell disease. More research is needed. This is an update of a previously published review. Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of evidence to be low to very low as all of the trials were at risk of bias and all had low participant numbers.",Treatments for priapism in boys and men with sickle cell disease,Chinegwundoh and  FI; Smith and  S; Anie and  KA,2,3,,
CD005502.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy remain refractory to drug treatment and continue to experience seizures whilst taking one or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Several non‐pharmacological interventions that may be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to AEDs are available for refractory patients. In view of the fact that seizures in people with intellectual disabilities are often complex and refractory to pharmacological interventions, it is evident that good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to assess the efficacy of alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacological interventions. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review ( Beavis 2007 ) published in  The Cochrane Library  (2007, Issue 4). Objectives To assess data derived from randomised controlled trials of non‐pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Non‐pharmacological interventions include, but are not limited to, the following. • Surgical procedures. • Specialised diets, for example, the ketogenic diet, or vitamin and folic acid supplementation. • Psychological interventions for patients or for patients and carers/parents, for example, cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback and educational intervention. • Yoga. • Acupuncture. • Relaxation therapy (e.g. music therapy). Search methods For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (19 August 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via CRSO (19 August 2014), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 19 August 2014) and PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1887 to 19 August 2014). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of non‐pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted study data. Main results One study is included in this review. When two surgical procedures were compared, results indicated that corpus callosotomy with anterior temporal lobectomy was more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. No evidence was found to support superior benefit in seizure control for either intervention. This is the only study of its kind and was rated as having an overall unclear risk of bias. The previous update (December 2010) identified one RCT in progress. The study authors have confirmed that they are aiming to publish by the end of 2015; therefore this study ( Bjurulf 2008 ) has not been included in the current review. Authors' conclusions This review highlights the need for well‐designed randomised controlled trials conducted to assess the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions on seizure and behavioural outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. Plain language summary Non‐pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterised by involuntary activity of the brain, which manifests in seizures. The rate of epilepsy in people with intellectual diabilities is significantly higher than in the general population. Epilepsy in this population is often less responsive to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. One relevant study comparing two surgical procedures has been included in this review. This study found that anterior corpus callosotomy (a procedure in which a section of the corpus callosum is severed) with anterior temporal lobectomy (a procedure in which part of the temporal lobe is removed) is more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. No support was found for a relative benefit of either procedure for improved seizure control. This review accentuates the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating non‐pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Given the prevalence and nature of epilepsy in this population, well‐designed RCTs are needed to ascertain the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions on seizure and behavioural outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities. However, good quality evidence derived from RCTs including the non‐intellectually disabled should be assessed for side effects and efficacy before such studies are undertaken.",Non‐pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities,Jackson and  CF; Makin and  SM; Marson and  AG; Kerr and  M,3,2,,
CD012568.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Systemic antimicrobials can be used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing (SRP)) as a non‐surgical treatment approach to manage periodontitis. A range of antibiotics with different dosage and combinations are documented in the literature. The review follows the previous classification of periodontitis as all included studies used this classification. Objectives To assess the effects of systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP for the non‐surgical treatment of patients with periodontitis. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 9 March 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which involved individuals with clinically diagnosed untreated periodontitis. Trials compared SRP with systemic antibiotics versus SRP alone/placebo, or with other systemic antibiotics. Data collection and analysis We selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 45 trials conducted worldwide involving 2664 adult participants. 14 studies were at low, 8 at high, and the remaining 23 at unclear overall risk of bias. Seven trials did not contribute data to the analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the 10 comparisons which reported long‐term follow‐up (≥ 1 year). None of the studies reported data on antimicrobial resistance and patient‐reported quality of life changes. Amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis:  the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD ‐16.20%, 95% CI ‐25.87 to ‐6.53; 1 study, 44 participants); clinical attachment level (CAL) (MD ‐0.47 mm, 95% CI ‐0.90 to ‐0.05; 2 studies, 389 participants); probing pocket depth (PD) (MD ‐0.30 mm, 95% CI ‐0.42 to ‐0.18; 2 studies, 389 participants); and percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) (MD ‐8.06%, 95% CI ‐14.26 to ‐1.85; 2 studies, 389 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for closed pockets and BOP showed a minimally important clinical difference (MICD) favouring amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP. Metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis:  the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD ‐12.20%, 95% CI ‐29.23 to 4.83; 1 study, 22 participants); CAL (MD ‐1.12 mm, 95% CI ‐2.24 to 0; 3 studies, 71 participants); PD (MD ‐1.11 mm, 95% CI ‐2.84 to 0.61; 2 studies, 47 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD ‐6.90%, 95% CI ‐22.10 to 8.30; 1 study, 22 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for CAL and PD showed an MICD favouring the MTZ + SRP group. Azithromycin + SRP versus SRP for chronic/aggressive periodontitis:  we found no evidence of a difference in percentage of closed pockets (MD 2.50%, 95% CI ‐10.19 to 15.19; 1 study, 40 participants); CAL (MD ‐0.59 mm, 95% CI ‐1.27 to 0.08; 2 studies, 110 participants); PD (MD ‐0.77 mm, 95% CI ‐2.33 to 0.79; 2 studies, 110 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD ‐1.28%, 95% CI ‐4.32 to 1.76; 2 studies, 110 participants) (very low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes). Amoxicillin + clavulanate + SRP versus SRP for chronic periodontitis:  the evidence from 1 study, 21 participants for CAL (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.71); PD (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.37); and BOP (MD 0%, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.09) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Doxycycline + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis:  the evidence from 1 study, 22 participants for CAL (MD ‐0.80 mm, 95% CI ‐1.49 to ‐0.11); and PD (MD ‐1.00 mm, 95% CI ‐1.78 to ‐0.22) was of very low certainty, with the doxycycline + SRP group showing an MICD in PD only. Tetracycline + SRP versus SRP for aggressive periodontitis:  we found very low‐certainty evidence of a difference in long‐term improvement in CAL for the tetracycline group (MD ‐2.30 mm, 95% CI ‐2.50 to ‐2.10; 1 study, 26 participants). Clindamycin + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis:  we found very low‐certainty evidence from 1 study, 21 participants of a difference in long‐term improvement in CAL (MD ‐1.70 mm, 95% CI ‐2.40 to ‐1.00); and PD (MD ‐1.80 mm, 95% CI ‐2.47 to ‐1.13) favouring clindamycin + SRP. Doxycycline + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis:  there was very low‐certainty evidence from 1 study, 27 participants of a difference in long‐term CAL (MD 1.10 mm, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84); and PD (MD 1.00 mm, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.70) favouring metronidazole + SRP. Clindamycin + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis:  the evidence from 1 study, 26 participants for CAL (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.95); and PD (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.78) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Clindamycin + SRP versus doxycycline + SRP for aggressive periodontitis:  the evidence from 1 study, 23 participants for CAL (MD ‐0.90 mm, 95% CI ‐1.62 to ‐0.18); and PD (MD ‐0.80 mm, 95% CI ‐1.58 to ‐0.02) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Most trials testing amoxicillin, metronidazole, and azithromycin reported adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mild gastrointestinal disturbances, and metallic taste. No serious adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions There is very low‐certainty evidence (for long‐term follow‐up) to inform clinicians and patients if adjunctive systemic antimicrobials are of any help for the non‐surgical treatment of periodontitis. There is insufficient evidence to decide whether some antibiotics are better than others when used alongside SRP. None of the trials reported serious adverse events but patients should be made aware of the common adverse events related to these drugs. Well‐planned RCTs need to be conducted clearly defining the minimally important clinical difference for the outcomes closed pockets, CAL, PD, and BOP. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of using antibiotics as well as cleaning by a dental care professional to treat gum disease? Why is this question important? Gum disease is a common condition in which the gums become swollen, sore or infected. It is caused by bacteria that accumulate on gums and teeth. Diseased gums may bleed when people brush their teeth, and may cause bad breath. If gum disease is not treated, teeth can become loose and eventually fall out. This can affect a person’s ability to chew and speak. It can also make people feel self‐conscious about their appearance. Dental‐care professionals can clean teeth and gums to remove excess bacteria from the mouth. They use special instruments – typically, an ultrasound scraper followed by specialised hand‐held instruments – to scrape bacteria from the teeth, and stop these from affecting the gums. Antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria) taken by mouth (orally) can be used alongside professional cleaning, to remove bacteria from the area between the teeth and gums. However, there are potential risks associated with antibiotics, such as allergic reactions and antibiotic resistance (changes in bacteria after exposure to antibiotics, that allow the bacteria to survive future antibiotic treatment). We conducted a review of the evidence from research studies to find out about the benefits and risks of using antibiotics alongside professional dental cleaning to treat gum disease. We also wanted to know if some antibiotics work better than others in this situation. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? First, we searched for randomized controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared the results, and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. What did we find? We found 45 studies that involved a total of 2664 people over the age of 18 who had gum disease. The studies compared professional cleaning plus antibiotics against professional cleaning alone, or compared different antibiotics used alongside professional cleaning against one another. We cannot tell whether antibiotics reduce gum disease in the long term (one year or more after treatment), or whether some antibiotics are better than others. This is because we have very little confidence in the evidence we found. We cannot tell whether antibiotics are associated with unwanted effects, because we have too little confidence in the evidence. The most commonly reported unwanted effects were temporary, mild gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or a metallic taste in the mouth. No serious unwanted effects were reported. No studies reported on antimicrobial resistance or changes in people’s quality of life. What does this mean? We do not know whether: ‐ using antibiotics alongside professional cleaning is beneficial for treating gum disease in the long term (more than one year after treatment);‐ using antibiotics alongside professional cleaning is associated with unwanted effects; or‐ some antibiotics are better than others for treating gum disease alongside professional cleaning. Our confidence in the available evidence is very low. The results of our review are likely to change if more evidence becomes available.

CD002312.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Pleural infection, including parapneumonic effusions and thoracic empyema, may complicate lower respiratory tract infections. Standard treatment of these collections in adults involves antibiotic therapy, effective drainage of infected fluid and surgical intervention if conservative management fails. Intrapleural fibrinolytic agents such as streptokinase and alteplase have been hypothesised to improve fluid drainage in complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema and therefore improve treatment outcomes and prevent the need for thoracic surgical intervention. Intrapleural fibrinolytic agents have been used in combination with DNase, but this is beyond the scope of this review. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of adding intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy to standard conservative therapy (intercostal catheter drainage and antibiotic therapy) in the treatment of complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. We contacted trial authors for further information and requested details regarding the possibility of unpublished trials. The most recent search was conducted on 28 August 2019. Selection criteria Parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult patients with post‐pneumonic empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusions (excluding tuberculous effusions) who had not had prior surgical intervention or trauma comparing an intrapleural fibrinolytic agent (streptokinase, alteplase or urokinase) versus placebo or a comparison of two fibrinolytic agents. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. We contacted study authors for further information. We used odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous data and reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures of meta‐analysis. We applied the GRADE approach to summarise results and to assess the overall certainty of evidence. Main results We included in this review a total of 12 RCTs. Ten studies assessed fibrinolytic agents versus placebo (993 participants); one study compared streptokinase with urokinase (50 participants); and one compared alteplase versus urokinase (99 participants). The primary outcomes were death, requirement for surgical intervention, overall treatment failure and serious adverse effects. All studies were in the inpatient setting. Outcomes were measured at varying time points from hospital discharge to three months. Seven trials were at low or unclear risk of bias and two at high risk of bias due to inadequate randomisation and inappropriate study design respectively. We found no evidence of difference in overall mortality with fibrinolytic versus placebo (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91; 8 studies, 867 participants; I² = 0%; moderate certainty of evidence). We found evidence of a reduction in surgical intervention with fibrinolysis in the same studies (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.68; 8 studies, 897 participants; I² = 51%; low certainty of evidence); and overall treatment failure (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.58; 7 studies, 769 participants; I² = 88%; very low certainty of evidence, with evidence of significant heterogeneity). We found no clear evidence of an increase in adverse effects with intrapleural fibrinolysis, although this cannot be excluded (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.57; low certainty of evidence). In a sensitivity analysis, the reduction in referrals for surgery and overall treatment failure with fibrinolysis disappeared when the analysis was confined to studies at low or unclear risk of bias. In a moderate‐risk population (baseline 14% risk of death, 20% risk of surgery, 27% risk of treatment failure), intra‐pleural fibrinolysis leads to 19 more deaths (36 fewer to 59 more), 115 fewer surgical interventions (150 fewer to 55 fewer) and 214 fewer overall treatment failures (252 fewer to 93 fewer) per 1000 people. A single study of streptokinase versus urokinase found no clear difference between the treatments for requirement for surgery (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.72; 50 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A single study of alteplase versus urokinase showed no clear difference in requirement for surgery (OR alteplase versus urokinase 0.46, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.24) but an increased rate of adverse effects, primarily bleeding, with alteplase (OR 5.61, 95% CI 1.16 to 27.11; 99 participants; low‐certainty evidence). This translated into 154 (6 to 499 more) serious adverse events with alteplase compared with urokinase per 1000 people treated. Authors' conclusions In patients with complicated infective pleural effusion or empyema, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy was associated with a reduction in the requirement for surgical intervention and overall treatment failure but with no evidence of change in mortality. Discordance between the negative largest trial of this therapy and other studies is of concern, however, as is an absence of significant effect when analysing low risk of bias trials only. The reasons for this difference are uncertain but may include publication bias. Intrapleural fibrinolytics may increase the rate of serious adverse events, but the evidence is insufficient to confirm or exclude this possibility. Plain language summary Clot‐busting drugs for infections of the lining of the lung Background Empyema and complicated parapneumonic effusion are conditions involving infected fluid gathering between the lung and the chest wall (the pleural space). They are treated by draining the fluid with a tube inserted through the chest into the fluid (a 'chest tube'), along with antibiotics. If this does not work, then surgery is usually needed to drain the fluid. Fibrinolytic drugs ('clot‐busting drugs') may make the infected pleural fluid thinner, less sticky and easier to drain via a chest tube, meaning that surgery may not be needed. Review question We wanted to know if fibrinolytics reduced the need for people with infections in the pleural space to have surgery to fix the infection. We also wanted to see if these medicines reduced the chance of people dying due to these infections; whether the fibrinolytic treatment worked overall; and whether these medicines caused serious side effects. We also wanted to know if one fibrinolytic medicine was more effective than another. Study characteristics We searched for studies up to August 2019. We included 10 studies with a total of 993 patients comparing fibrinolytics with a placebo and compared these to look for differences. We also included two studies comparing different fibrinolytics with a total of 149 patients and compared these separately. Key findings We found some low‐certainty evidence that fibrinolytics moderately reduced the need for surgery. There was no clear evidence that fibrinolytics changed the risk of death. There was some low‐certainty evidence which showed that there may be a risk of more side effects (mostly bleeding) with fibrinolytics but this is uncertain. We found no clear evidence that any single fibrinolytic was better than another. Certainty of the evidence We considered the certainty of the evidence identified comparing fibrinolytic with placebo to vary from moderate (risk of death) to very low (overall treatment failure). This was mostly due to some studies having one or more domains at high risk of bias as well as concerns that not all studies of this treatment appear to have been published. We considered the evidence comparing individual fibrinolytics to be of low certainty due to not enough patients in the studies as well as one study being at a high risk of bias.","Intra‐pleural fibrinolytic therapy versus placebo, or a different fibrinolytic agent, in the treatment of adult parapneumonic effusions and empyema",Altmann and  ES; Crossingham and  I; Wilson and  S; Davies and  HR,2,3,,
CD010954.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Patients with head and neck cancer are often malnourished. Surgery for such cancers is complex and may be undertaken after a course of radiotherapy. As a result, patients may have postoperative complications such as fistulae and wound infections, as well as more generalised infections such as pneumonia. One possible way to enhance recovery, and reduce the incidence of these complications, is by improving nutrition. Nutritional formulas that deliver basic nutrients as well as amino acids (arginine and glutamine), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and/or lipids (omega‐3 fatty acids) are known as immunonutrition. Objectives To assess the effects of immunonutrition treatment, compared to standard feeding, on postoperative recovery in adult patients undergoing elective (non‐emergency) surgery for head and neck cancer. Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 February 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing immunonutrition given either preoperatively, postoperatively or perioperatively to adult patients (18 years of age or older) undergoing an elective surgical procedure for head and neck cancer, compared with a control group receiving either standard polymeric nutritional supplements or no supplements. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were: length of hospital stay (days), wound infection, fistula formation and adverse events/tolerance of feeds, as defined by trial authors. Secondary outcomes were: all‐cause mortality and postoperative complications (as defined by trial authors). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in  italics . Main results We included 19 RCTs (1099 participants). The mean age of participants ranged from 47 to 66 years. Most studies (12/19) had fewer than 25 patients in each treatment group. Most studies (16/19) used immunonutrition formulas containing arginine, but there was variation in the actual products and amounts used, and in the length of intervention postoperatively. Follow‐up time for outcome measurement varied considerably across studies, ranging from five days to greater than or equal to 16 months. Primary outcomes We found no evidence of a difference in the length of hospital stay (mean difference ‐2.5 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐5.11 to 0.12; 10 studies, 757 participants;  low‐quality evidence ). Similarly, we found no evidence of an effect of immunonutrition on wound infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.26; 12 studies, 812 participants;  very low‐quality evidence ). Fistula formation may be reduced with immunonutrition; the absolute risks were 11.3% and 5.4% in the standard care and immunonutrition groups, with a RR of 0.48 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.85; 10 studies, 747 participants;  low‐quality evidence ). We found no evidence of a difference in terms of tolerance of feeds ('adverse events') between treatments (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.06; 9 studies, 719 participants;  very low‐quality evidence ). Secondary outcomes We found no evidence of a difference between treatments in all‐cause mortality (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.66; 14 studies, 776 participants;  low‐quality evidence ). Other postoperative complications such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections were not commonly reported. Authors' conclusions The risk of postoperative fistula formation may be reduced with immunonutrition, but we found no evidence of an effect of immunonutrition on any of the other outcomes that we assessed. The studies included in this review were generally small or at high risk of bias (or both). We judged the overall quality of the evidence to be  low  for the outcomes length of hospital stay and all‐cause mortality, and  very low  for wound infection and adverse events. Further research should include larger, better quality studies. Plain language summary Immunonutrition for patients undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer Review question This review compared how people recover after surgery for head and neck cancer if they have been given either 'immunonutrition' or a standard feed before and after or only after the surgery. We looked at how long people stayed in hospital, whether they had any complications and how many people in each treatment group died. Background Head and neck cancer surgery usually means surgery to treat cancer of the mouth, throat or larynx (voice box). The surgery is complicated and people often experience problems such as wound infections and wound breakdown, as well as infections such as pneumonia. These can lead to a longer stay in hospital. Specific nutrients, for example amino acids (found in protein‐based foods), omega‐3 fatty acids (often found in fish oils) and nucleotides (found in many foods) have been investigated for their role in helping people recover from surgery. When any of these specific nutrients are added to the patient's feed it is called immunonutrition. We wanted to see whether feeding people immunonutrition improved recovery (for example, led to a shorter length of stay and fewer complications) when compared with a standard feed. Study characteristics We included 19 studies that recruited 1099 adults in total (studies ranged in size from 8 to 209 participants, but most (12 out of 19) had fewer than 25 participants per treatment group). The studies focused on people who were given immunonutrition or a standard feed before and after or only after their surgery. The studies varied in the length of time over which people were given the feeds, but this was usually at least five days. The evidence is current to February 2018. Key results We did not find evidence of a difference in the length of hospital stay but there was wide variation between the individual studies in what they showed. We found some evidence that people who had immunonutrition may be about half as likely to have breakdown of their surgical wound called a fistula (a channel between the inside of the throat and the surface skin). We found no evidence that immunonutrition had any effect on wound infection (but not all studies were clear in how they measured this) or death. Study feeds were generally well tolerated and there was no evidence of a difference in adverse events such as diarrhoea between treatment groups. Other clinical complications such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections were not commonly reported, but there was little evidence of a reduction with immunonutrition. Quality of the evidence Most studies included in this review were small and poorly reported, which means that their results may be less reliable. More studies are needed that are larger, of better quality and conducted within current healthcare systems.",Immunonutrition for patients undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer,Howes and  N; Atkinson and  C; Thomas and  S; Lewis and  SJ,2,3,,
CD002115.PUB5,"Abstract - Background People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with any management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003 and 2006. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post‐traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Objectives To determine the effects of management strategies for faecal incontinence and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials Register (searched 8 June 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative or surgical intervention for the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury were selected. Specific therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases that indirectly affect bowel dysfunction were also considered. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of pre‐specified outcome measures. Main results Twenty trials involving 902 people were included. Oral medications There was evidence from individual small trials that people with Parkinson's disease had a statistically significant improvement in the number of bowel motions or successful bowel care routines per week when fibre (psyllium) (mean difference (MD) ‐2.2 bowel motions, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.3 to ‐1.4) or oral laxative (isosmotic macrogol electrolyte solution) (MD 2.9 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.32) are used compared with placebo. One trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time comparing intramuscular neostigmine‐glycopyrrolate (anticholinesterase plus an anticholinergic drug) with placebo (MD 23.3 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 41.92). Five studies reported the use of cisapride and tegaserod in people with spinal cord injuries or Parkinson's disease. These drugs have since been withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects; as they are no longer available they have been removed from this review. Rectal stimulants One small trial in people with spinal cord injuries compared two bisacodyl suppositories, one polyethylene glycol‐based (PGB) and one hydrogenated vegetable oil‐based (HVB). The trial found that the PGB bisacodyl suppository significantly reduced the mean defaecation period (PGB 20 minutes versus HVB 36 minutes, P < 0.03) and mean total time for bowel care (PGB 43 minutes versus HVB 74.5 minutes, P < 0.01) compared with the HVB bisacodyl suppository. Physical interventions There was evidence from one small trial with 31 participants that abdominal massage statistically improved the number of bowel motions in people who had a stroke compared with no massage (MD 1.7 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 2.22 to 1.18). A small feasibility trial including 30 individuals with multiple sclerosis also found evidence to support the use of abdominal massage. Constipation scores were statistically better with the abdominal massage during treatment although this was not supported by a change in outcome measures (for example the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score). One small trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time using electrical stimulation of abdominal muscles compared with no electrical stimulation (MD 29.3 minutes, 95% CI 7.35 to 51.25). There was evidence from one trial with a low risk of bias that for people with spinal cord injury transanal irrigation, compared against conservative bowel care, statistically improved constipation scores, neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, faecal incontinence score and total time for bowel care (MD 27.4 minutes, 95% CI 7.96 to 46.84). Patients were also more satisfied with this method. Other interventions In one trial in stroke patients, there appeared to be a short term benefit (less than six months) to patients in terms of the number of bowel motions per week with a one‐off educational intervention from nurses (a structured nurse assessment leading to targeted education versus routine care), but this did not persist at 12 months. A trial in individuals with spinal cord injury found that a stepwise protocol did not reduce the need for oral laxatives and manual evacuation of stool. Finally, one further trial reported in abstract form showed that oral carbonated water (rather than tap water) improved constipation scores in people who had had a stroke. Authors' conclusions There is still remarkably little research on this common and, to patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other. There was very limited evidence from individual trials in favour of a bulk‐forming laxative (psyllium), an isosmotic macrogol laxative, abdominal massage, electrical stimulation and an anticholinesterase‐anticholinergic drug combination (neostigmine‐glycopyrrolate) compared to no treatment or controls. There was also evidence in favour of transanal irrigation (compared to conservative management), oral carbonated (rather than tap) water and abdominal massage with lifestyle advice (compared to lifestyle advice alone). However, these findings need to be confirmed by larger well‐designed controlled trials which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life. Plain language summary Management of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central nervous system diseases Individuals with central nervous system disease or injury have a much higher risk of loss of bowel control and severe constipation than other people. This is called neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD). It can be very difficult to treat constipation without causing bowel leakage, or to prevent bowel leakage without causing constipation. The time spent on emptying the bowel is nearly always much greater for these individuals. Bowel problems like this cause a lot of anxiety and distress and can reduce the quality of life of those who suffer them. This review of research about NBD could be of interest to individuals with any damage to the central nervous system caused by disease or injury, or present at birth, which has a long term effect on how their bowel works. While there is a great deal of information on the causes of NBD, there are few studies that focus on how to practically manage the problem. Currently the usual advice is to have a good fluid intake, a balanced diet, as much physical exercise as is practical and a regular planned bowel routine. A bowel routine may include use of oral laxative medicines, suppositories or enemas; abdominal massage; digital rectal stimulation and digital evacuation of stool. The steps used will depend on the needs of each individual and some degree of trial and error is usually needed to achieve a satisfactory routine. Only research studies where participants were allocated to either the control group (who received either no intervention or usual care) or the treatment group by chance (called randomisation) were included in this review as these studies provide the most reliable evidence. Fifteen new studies have been added in this update. Five have been removed because the drugs the studies reported on (cisapride and tegaserod) have been withdrawn from the market and are no longer available. Most of the 20 randomised studies in this review included very small numbers of participants and the study reports did not always give the information needed to be sure that the study findings were reliable. Some oral laxatives were found to improve bowel function including psyllium, a stool‐bulking laxative (one study), and an isosmotic macrogol (one study), which were both studied in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Some suppositories and micro‐enemas used to help the bowel to open produced faster results than others (three studies) and the timing of suppository use may affect the response of the bowel (one study). Digital evacuation of stool may be more effective than oral or rectal medication (one study). The use of transanal irrigation in individuals with spinal cord injury improved bowel control, constipation and quality of life measures (one study). Three studies found that abdominal massage was helpful in reducing constipation. One study found that patients may benefit from even one educational contact with a nurse. This review shows that there is still remarkably little research on this common problem which is so important to patients. The research evidence found by the review is generally very poor because the way the studies were carried out and",Management of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central neurological diseases,Coggrave and  M; Norton and  C; Cody and  JD,1,3,,
CD008628.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) comprise up to 2% of all fractures. These fractures are mostly caused by a fall from a height, and are common in younger adults. Treatment can be surgical or non‐surgical; however, there is clinical uncertainty over optimal management. Objectives To assess the effects of surgical compared with conservative treatment of displaced intra‐articular calcaneal fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to July 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library , 2011 Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948 to July 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 27), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials, and Orthopaedic Trauma Association annual meeting archives (1996 to 2011). Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies comparing surgical versus conservative management for displaced intra‐articular calcaneal fractures. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were function (e.g. walking ability) and chronic pain. Risk ratios were calculated for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Missing standard deviations were calculated from P values. Main results Four trials were included (602 participants). Three trials were small single‐centre trials, and the fourth a large multi‐centre trial including 424 participants. All trials had methodological flaws, usually failure to conceal allocation and incomplete follow‐up data, which put them at high risk of bias. Follow‐up ranged from 1 to 15 years after treatment. Data for functional outcomes, including walking ability, from three trials could not be pooled. The strongest evidence was from the multi‐centre trial. This showed no statistically or clinically significant differences between the surgical and conservatively treated groups at three years follow‐up in the ''validated disease‐specific' score (0 to 100: perfect result; 424 participants; mean difference (MD) 4.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.11 to 9.71; P = 0.12). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the risk of chronic pain at follow‐up (19/40 versus 24/42; risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.18; 2 trials). The multi‐centre trial found no statistically or clinically significant difference between the two groups in health‐related quality of life at three years follow‐up (SF‐36 (0 to 100: best outcome): MD 4.00, 95% CI ‐1.16 to 9.16; P = 0.13). Two small trials provided some limited evidence of a tendency for a higher return to previous employment after surgery (27/34 versus 15/27; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.81; I² = 55%; 2 trials). One small trial found no difference between the two groups in the ability to wear normal shoes, whereas another small trial found that surgery resulted in more people who were able to wear all shoes comfortably. There was a higher rate of major complications, such as surgical site infection, after surgery compared with conservative treatment (57/206 versus 42/218; RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.04; 1 trial). Conversely, significantly fewer surgical participants had subtalar arthrodeses due to the development of subtalar arthritis (7/206 versus 37/218; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; 1 trial). There were no significant differences between the two groups in range of movement outcomes or radiological measurements (e.g. Bohler's angle). Authors' conclusions The bulk of the evidence in this review derives from one large multi‐centre but inadequately reported trial conducted over 15 years ago. This found no significant differences between surgical or conservative treatment in functional ability and health related quality of life at three years after displaced intra‐articular calcaneal fracture. Though it reported a greater risk of major complications after surgery, subtalar arthrodeses for the development of subtalar arthritis was significantly greater after conservative treatment. Overall, there is insufficient high quality evidence relating to current practice to establish whether surgical or conservative treatment is better for adults with displaced intra‐articular calcaneal fracture. Evidence from adequately powered randomised, multi‐centre controlled trials, assessing patient‐centred and clinically relevant outcomes is required. However, it would be prudent to reassess this need after an update of the review that incorporates new evidence from a currently ongoing multi‐centre trial. Plain language summary Surgery or non‐surgical treatment for broken heel bones Fractures or breaks of the heel bone mostly involve a joint within the heel. These injuries can be difficult to treat and manage. This injury typically occurs in young adults after a fall from a height. Heel fractures are painful and cause significant disability because they prevent weight‐bearing for many weeks after injury. These fractures restrict physical activity, delay return to work and usual activities, and can have other consequences, such as being unable to wear the same shoes as before injury. Treatment of heel fractures can be broadly divided into surgical or non‐surgical (conservative) management. Surgery involves a procedure where a plate and screws are inserted into the heel to stabilise the broken bones. This is usually followed by a period of non‐weight bearing of six to eight weeks. Non‐surgical treatment initially involves leg elevation, ice and plaster cast splints and then gradual introduction of non‐weight bearing mobilisation for six to eight weeks. Currently, there is no consensus over which is the best management strategy for patients. This review included four studies (602 participants) that have looked at the results of surgery compared with non‐surgical treatment for people who have had a heel fracture. The strongest evidence comes from one large multi‐centre Canadian trial that recruited 424 participants. The remaining studies were small. All four studies had weaknesses in their design, conduct and reporting. Based mainly on the results from the largest study, the review found no strong evidence of differences between surgical and non‐surgical treatment in functional ability, including walking, and quality of life, at three years after treatment. From two small studies, there is some evidence that participants having surgery were more likely to return to work more quickly. However, those having surgery were more likely to have a major complication such as surgical site infection after treatment. Conversely, those having surgery were less likely to have joint fusion surgery because they had developed arthritis later on. The review concluded that there was currently insufficient evidence to say whether surgical or non‐surgical treatment of heel fractures is best. Further good quality research is recommended.",Surgical versus conservative interventions for displaced intra‐articular calcaneal fractures,Bruce and  J; Sutherland and  A,2,3,,
CD009363.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Clavicle fractures are common, accounting for 2.6% to 4% of all fractures. Eighty per cent of clavicle fractures are located in the middle third of the clavicle. Although treatment of these fractures is usually non‐surgical, displaced clavicle fractures may be considered for surgical treatment because of their greater risk of non‐union. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus conservative interventions for treating middle third clavicle fractures. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, trials registries and reference lists updated to December 2017. We did not apply any language or publication restrictions. Selection criteria We considered randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials evaluating surgical versus conservative interventions for treating fractures in the middle third of the clavicle. The primary outcomes were shoulder function or disability, pain and treatment failure, defined as the number of participants who had been given a non‐routine secondary surgical intervention (excluding hardware removal), for symptomatic non‐union, malunion or other complications. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors selected eligible studies, independently assessed risk of bias and cross‐checked data. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable studies. Main results We included 14 studies involving 1469 participants with acute middle third clavicle fractures. All studies included adults, with the overall range from 17 to 70 years. Of the studies that reported gender, men were over‐represented. Ten studies compared plate fixation with sling or figure‐of‐eight bandage, or both, and four studies compared intramedullary fixation with wearing either a sling or a figure‐of‐eight bandage. Almost all studies had design features that carry a high risk of bias, thus limiting the strength of their findings. Low‐quality evidence from 10 studies (838 participants), showed that, compared with conservative treatment, surgical treatment of acute middle third clavicle fractures may not improve upper arm function at follow‐up of one year or longer: standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.02 to 0.67. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of risk of bias and high statistical heterogeneity (I 2  = 83%). This corresponds to a mean improvement of 2.3 points in favour of surgery (0.14 points worse to 4.69 points better), on the 100‐point Constant score; this does not represent a clinically important difference. There may be no difference in pain measured using a visual analogue scale (0 to 100 mm; higher scores mean worse pain) between treatments (mean difference (MD) −0.60 mm, 95% CI −3.51 to 2.31; 277 participants, 3 studies; low‐quality evidence reflecting risk of bias and imprecision). Surgery may reduce the risk of treatment failure, that is, number of participants who had non‐routine secondary surgical intervention (excluding hardware removal), for symptomatic non‐union, malunion or other complication (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.50; 1197 participants, 12 studies; low‐quality evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). The main source of treatment failure was mechanical failure (3.4%) in the surgery group and symptomatic non‐union (11.6%) in the conservative‐treatment group. We are uncertain whether surgery results in fewer people having one or more cosmetic problems, such as deformities, which were more common after conservative treatment, or hardware prominence or scarring, which only occurred in the surgery group (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.98; 1130 participants, 11 studies; I 2  = 63%; very low‐quality evidence downgraded for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency). We are uncertain whether there is any difference between surgery and conservative treatment in the risk of incurring an adverse outcome that includes local infection, dehiscence, symptomatic malunion, discomfort leading to implant removal, skin and nerve problems: RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.64; 1317 participants, 14 studies; I 2  = 72%; very low‐quality evidence, downgraded for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency). Hardware removal for discomfort was a common adverse outcome in the surgery group (10.2%) while symptomatic malunion was more common in the conservative‐treatment group (11.3% versus 1.2% in the surgery group). Infection occurred only in the surgery group (3.2%). There may be no between‐group difference in quality of life at one year (SF‐12 or SF‐36 physical component scores: 0 to 100 scale, where 100 is the best score): MD 0.30 (95% CI −1.95 to 2.56, 321 participants, 2 studies; low‐quality evidence downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). Authors' conclusions There is low‐quality evidence that surgical treatment has no additional benefits in terms of function, pain and quality of life compared with conservative treatment, but may result in fewer treatment failures overall. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain of the findings of a slightly better cosmetic result after surgery and of no difference between surgical and conservative treatment in the risk of adverse events. For both composite outcomes, there is a need to consider the balance of risks between the individual outcomes; for example, surgical adverse events, including wound infection or dehiscence and hardware irritation, against risk of adverse events that may be more commonly associated with conservative treatment such as symptomatic malunion and shoulder stiffness. Treatment options must be chosen on an individual patient basis, after careful consideration of the relative benefits and harms of each intervention and of patient preferences. Plain language summary Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating broken collarbones in adolescents and adults This summary presents what we know from research about the effects of surgery compared with non‐surgical (conservative) treatments, such as wearing a sling or a figure‐of‐eight bandage for two to six weeks to treat a fractured (broken) collarbone. Background The collarbone, or clavicle, acts as a bridge across the front of the chest to connect the arm and the rib cage. It helps to stabilise the shoulder while allowing the arm to move freely, and provides an area of attachment for muscles, functioning also as part of the musculoskeletal apparatus used in breathing. The collarbone also protects nerves and blood vessels and plays an important aesthetic role in a person's physical appearance. The most common site of clavicle fracture is the middle third of the clavicle. The injury typically occurs in youths and older adults. It usually results from a fall directly onto the outer side of the shoulder. Most middle third collarbone fractures are treated conservatively (non‐surgically). However, outcome can be unsatisfactory for the more serious fractures. Surgical treatment involves putting the bone back in place and, usually, performing internal fixation by using a plate and screws or a metal rod, which is inserted into the inner cavity (medulla) of the clavicle bone. Results of the search We searched medical databases up to December 2017 and included 14 studies involving 1469 participants with displaced or angulated middle third clavicle fractures. All participants were adults, ranging in age from 17 to 70 years, and there were more men than women. Ten studies compared plate fixation with conservative intervention (sling and/or figure‐of‐eight bandage), and four studies compared intramedullary fixation with wearing either a sling or a figure‐of‐eight bandage. Key results The review showed that surgery compared with conservative treatment may not improve upper arm function, pain and quality of life one year later. However, surgery may reduce the risk of treatment failure where secondary surgery is required for fractures that did not heal or that healed incorrectly. We are uncertain whether surgery provides a better cosmetic result overall. Although surgery reduces shoulder deformity, it can result in unsightly scars and prominent metalwork. We are also uncertain if there is a difference between surgery and conservative treatment in the risk of having a complication. However the nature of such complications often differs according to treatment. Complications of surgery, such as wound infection and opening, or hardware irritation requiring additional surgery, need to be balanced against complications more likely to occur with a sling, such as shoulder stiffness and failure of the fracture to heal properly. Quality of the evidence All 14 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered that the evidence for all outcomes was either of low or very low quality. Conclusion Low‐quality evidence indicates that surgery may not result in benefits over conservative treatment, or in more complications. However we are uncertain about these effects and further studies may change these conclusions.",Surgical versus conservative interventions for treating fractures of the middle third of the clavicle,Lenza and  M; Buchbinder and  R; Johnston and  RV; Ferrari and  BAS; Faloppa and  F,2,3,,
CD002270,"Abstract - Background Intraventricular hemorrhage remains a serious complication of premature birth and post‐hemorrhagic hydrocephalus still has no satisfactory treatment. Acetazolamide and furosemide, which both reduce the production of cerebrospinal fluid, have been suggested as non‐invasive therapies to reduce hydrocephalus and the need for ventriculo‐peritoneal (V‐P) shunting. Objectives To determine the effect of acetazolamide and furosemide on shunt dependence and other complications in infants developing post‐hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. Search methods Searches were performed of electronic databases (MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1974 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library). PubMed was searched on April 18, 2007 and Issue 2, 2007 of The Cochrane Library was searched. Selection criteria Randomised, or quasi‐randomised trials, of acetazolamide and/or furosemide compared with standard therapy in infants with IVH or post‐hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by each author and were analysed by the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD), a fixed effect model and sensitivity analyses where appropriate. Main results There were two eligible trials: one randomized 16 infants and the other 177 infants. Neither study showed a decreased risk for V‐P shunt or for V‐P shunt or death associated with acetazolamide and furosemide therapy. The larger trial showed that acetazolamide and furosemide treatment resulted in a borderline increase in the risk for motor impairment at one year (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 ‐ 1.58; RD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 ‐ 0.31), but did not significantly affect the risk for the combined outcome of delay, disability or motor impairment among survivors, or the risk of the combined outcome of death, delay, disability or impairment at one year. The larger trial showed that diuretic treatment increased the risk for nephrocalcinosis (RR 5.31, 95% CI 1.90 ‐ 14.84; RD 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 ‐ 0.29); meta‐analysis confirmed this result. Authors' conclusions Acetazolamide and furosemide therapy is neither effective nor safe in treating post‐hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. Acetazolamide and furosemide cannot be recommended as therapy for post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Plain language summary Diuretic therapy for newborn infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation Bleeding (hemorrhage) into the fluid‐producing cavities (ventricles) of the brain is a serious complication of premature birth. Large hemorrhages may result in fluid building up under pressure, progressively enlarging the brain and head. Current treatment approaches, including the insertion of a valve drainage system (shunt) are fraught with problems. Acetazolamide and furosemide, two drugs with diuretic action, reduce the production of fluid in the ventricles of the brain and have been proposed as safe treatments to treat dilatation of the ventricles after intraventricular hemorrhage in newborn infants. When compared with standard treatment, diuretic therapy was found not to reduce the need for shunt surgery. Diuretic drugs are neither safe nor effective in treating ventricular dilatation in infants with intraventricular hemorrhage.",Diuretic therapy for newborn infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation,Whitelaw and  A; Brion and  LP; Kennedy and  CR; Odd and  D,3,2,,
CD007908.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Dislocation of the elbow joint is a relatively uncommon injury. Objectives To assess the effects of various forms of treatment for acute simple elbow dislocations in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library , 2011 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to March Week 5 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 14), PEDro (April 2011), CINAHL (April 2011), various trial registers, various conference proceedings and bibliographies of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of conservative and surgical treatment of dislocations of the elbow in adults. Excluded were trials involving dislocations with associated fractures, except for avulsion fractures. Data collection and analysis Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were independently performed by two review authors. There was no pooling of data. Main results Two small randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 80 participants with simple elbow dislocations, were included. Both trials were methodologically flawed and potentially biased. One trial, involving 50 participants, compared early mobilisation at three days post reduction versus cast immobilisation. At one year follow‐up, the recovery of range of motion appeared better in the early mobilisation group (e.g. participants with incomplete recovery of extension: 1/24 versus 5/26; risk ratio 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.72). However, the results were not statistically significant. There were no reports of instability or recurrence. One person in each group had residual pain at one year. The other trial, involving 30 participants, compared surgical repair of the torn ligaments versus conservative treatment (cast immobilisation for two weeks). At final follow‐up (mean 27.5 months), there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the numbers of patients who considered their injured elbow to be inferior to their non‐injured elbow (10/14 versus 7/14; RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.66) or in other patient complaints about their elbow such as weakness, pain or weather‐related discomfort. There were no reports of instability or recurrence. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in range of motion of the elbow (extension, flexion, pronation, and supination) or grip strength at follow‐up. No participants had neurological disturbances of the hand but two surgical group participants had recurrent dislocation of the ulnar nerve (no other details provided). One person in each group had radiologically detected myositis ossificans (bone formation within muscles following injury). Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine which method of treatment is the most appropriate for simple dislocations of the elbow in adults. Although weak and inconclusive, the available evidence from a trial comparing surgery versus conservative treatment does not suggest that the surgical repair of elbow ligaments for simple elbow dislocation improves long‐term function. Future research should focus on questions relating to non‐surgical treatment, such as the duration of immobilisation. Plain language summary Interventions for treating acute elbow dislocations in adults Elbow dislocation is where the joint surfaces of the elbow become completely separated from each other. It is a relatively uncommon injury. After the bones of the elbow joint are put back into place, under sedation and/or anaesthesia, the arm is usually immobilised in a cast for a week or more. Removal of the cast is often followed by physical therapy aimed at restoring elbow mobility. Surgery is usually reserved for the more severe dislocations, which are generally associated with a fracture (broken bone). This review includes two trials, involving a total of 80 adults with simple elbow dislocations that had been put back into place (reduced). Both trials were at risk of bias, which means that their results may not be reliable. One trial compared early mobilisation of the elbow with immobilisation for three weeks in a plaster cast. This trial found no firm evidence of differences between the two interventions in the recovery of elbow range of motion or pain at one year. None of the trial participants had an unstable elbow or had suffered another dislocation. The other trial compared surgical repair of the torn ligaments versus conservative treatment (cast immobilisation for two weeks). It found no significant difference between the two groups in the numbers of patients who considered their injured elbow to be inferior to their non‐injured elbow or in other patient complaints about their elbow such as weakness, pain or weather‐related discomfort. There were also no differences between the groups in the range of motion of the elbow or grip strength at follow‐up of around two years. There were two people with surgery‐related complications. None of the trial participants had an unstable elbow or had suffered another dislocation. Overall, the review concluded that there was not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to show which methods of treatment are better for these injuries.",Interventions for treating acute elbow dislocations in adults,Taylor and  F; Sims and  M; Theis and  JC; Herbison and  GP,2,3,,
CD012602.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. An estimated 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Miscarriage can lead to serious morbidity, including haemorrhage, infection, and even death, particularly in settings without adequate healthcare provision. Early miscarriages occur during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and can be managed expectantly, medically or surgically. However, there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and risks of each option. Objectives To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different management methods for early miscarriage, and to provide rankings of the available methods according to their effectiveness, safety, and side‐effect profile using a network meta‐analysis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register (9 February 2021),  ClinicalTrials.gov  and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (12 February 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of methods for miscarriage management. Early miscarriage was defined as less than or equal to 14 weeks of gestation, and included missed and incomplete miscarriage. Management of late miscarriages after 14 weeks of gestation (often referred to as intrauterine fetal deaths) was not eligible for inclusion in the review. Cluster‐ and quasi‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded non‐randomised trials. Data collection and analysis At least three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for the primary outcomes of complete miscarriage and composite outcome of death or serious complications. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Relative effects for the primary outcomes are reported subgrouped by the type of miscarriage (incomplete and missed miscarriage). We also performed pairwise meta‐analyses and network meta‐analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available methods. Main results Our network meta‐analysis included 78 randomised trials involving 17,795 women from 37 countries. Most trials (71/78) were conducted in hospital settings and included women with missed or incomplete miscarriage. Across 158 trial arms, the following methods were used: 51 trial arms (33%) used misoprostol; 50 (32%) used suction aspiration; 26 (16%) used expectant management or placebo; 17 (11%) used dilatation and curettage; 11 (6%) used mifepristone plus misoprostol; and three (2%) used suction aspiration plus cervical preparation. Of these 78 studies, 71 (90%) contributed data in a usable form for meta‐analysis. Complete miscarriage Based on the relative effects from the network meta‐analysis of 59 trials (12,591 women), we found that five methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for achieving a complete miscarriage: · suction aspiration after cervical preparation (risk ratio (RR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.20, low‐certainty evidence), · dilatation and curettage (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75, low‐certainty evidence), · suction aspiration (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.62, low‐certainty evidence), · mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.66, moderate‐certainty evidence), · misoprostol (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46, low‐certainty evidence). The highest ranked surgical method was suction aspiration after cervical preparation. The highest ranked non‐surgical treatment was mifepristone plus misoprostol. All surgical methods were ranked higher than medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Composite outcome of death and serious complications Based on the relative effects from the network meta‐analysis of 35 trials (8161 women), we found that four methods with available data were compatible with a wide range of treatment effects compared with expectant management or placebo: · dilatation and curettage (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.06, low‐certainty evidence), · suction aspiration (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.32, low‐certainty evidence), · misoprostol (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.15, low‐certainty evidence), · mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.84, low‐certainty evidence). Importantly, no deaths were reported in these studies, thus this composite outcome was entirely composed of serious complications, including blood transfusions, uterine perforations, hysterectomies, and intensive care unit admissions. Expectant management and placebo ranked the lowest when compared with alternative treatment interventions. Subgroup analyses by type of miscarriage (missed or incomplete) agreed with the overall analysis in that surgical methods were the most effective treatment, followed by medical methods and then expectant management or placebo, but there are possible subgroup differences in the effectiveness of the available methods.  Authors' conclusions Based on relative effects from the network meta‐analysis, all surgical and medical methods for managing a miscarriage may be more effective than expectant management or placebo. Surgical methods were ranked highest for managing a miscarriage, followed by medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Expectant management or placebo had the highest chance of serious complications, including the need for unplanned or emergency surgery. A subgroup analysis showed that surgical and medical methods may be more beneficial in women with missed miscarriage compared to women with incomplete miscarriage. Since type of miscarriage (missed and incomplete) appears to be a source of inconsistency and heterogeneity within these data, we acknowledge that the main network meta‐analysis may be unreliable. However, we plan to explore this further in future updates and consider the primary analysis as separate networks for missed and incomplete miscarriage.  Plain language summary Which management option is best when women experience an early miscarriage? What is the issue? Miscarriage is the most common cause of pregnancy loss and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% of pregnancies will end in miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Miscarriage can lead to serious complications, including haemorrhage and infection, and even death, particularly in low‐income countries. Miscarriage is generally defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation. Most miscarriages happen in the first 14 weeks, and are known as early miscarriages. Why is this important? Miscarriage can be managed expectantly (waiting for the pregnancy tissue to pass naturally), medically (tablets given to make the womb expel the pregnancy tissue) or surgically (removal of the pregnancy tissue during surgery). However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side effects of the available methods for managing a miscarriage. The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out which method is the most effective and safest with the least side effects. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence in February 2021 and identified 78 studies involving 17,795 women. Most women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with missed (also called silent miscarriage where no pregnancy tissue has been expelled and there is no bleeding or pain) or incomplete miscarriage (already started to bleed or have pain and perhaps expelled some pregnancy tissue). We found evidence for six different methods of managing a miscarriage; three surgical methods (suction aspiration plus cervical preparation, dilatation and curettage, or suction aspiration), two medical methods (mifepristone plus misoprostol or misoprostol alone), and expectant management or placebo. The analysis suggested that all three surgical methods and both medical methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for completing the process of miscarriage. Suction aspiration plus cervical preparation was the best method of miscarriage management followed by dilatation and curettage, and suction aspiration alone. The two medical methods of mifepristone combined with misoprostol, and misoprostol alone were ranked fourth and fifth best methods, respectively. From the available data, we cannot learn much for the outcome of death or serious complications. No deaths were reported in the studies that contributed towards this outcome. Amongst the serious complications, the majority were women who required blood transfusions, some had womb perforations related to surgery or required further life‐saving procedures. We could not know which method is best for this outcome due to limited data. However, expectant management or placebo was associated with more serious complications compared with the alternative treatment options. We also looked separately at women suffering from an incomplete miscarriage compared to those suffering from a missed miscarriage. For both groups of women, all three surgical methods and both medical methods were found to be more effective than expectant management or placebo for providing a definitive treatment for a miscarriage. These analyses for incomplete and missed miscarriages agreed with the overall analysis in that surgical methods were better for providing a definitive treatment for a miscarriage than medical methods, which in turn were better than expectant management or placebo. However, the benefits for women with mis",Methods for managing miscarriage: a network meta‐analysis,Ghosh and  J; Papadopoulou and  A; Devall and  AJ; Jeffery and  HC; Beeson and  LE; Do and  V; Price and  MJ; Tobias and  A; Tunçalp and  Ö; Lavelanet and  A; Gülmezoglu and  AM; Coomarasamy and  A; Gallos and  ID,3,2,,
CD006983.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Leprosy causes nerve damage which may result in nerve function impairment and disability. Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage, although the effect is uncertain. This is an update of a review first published in 2009 and previously updated in 2010. Objectives To assess the effects of decompressive surgery on nerve damage in leprosy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (15 October 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 9 in  The Cochrane Library ), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2012), AMED (January 1985 to October 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to October 2012) and LILACS (from January 1982 to October 2012). We checked reference lists of the studies identified, the Current Controlled Trials Register (www.controlled‐trials.com) (1 November 2012), conference proceedings and contacted trial authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of decompressive surgery for nerve damage in leprosy. Data collection and analysis The primary outcome was improvement in sensory and motor nerve function after one year. Secondary outcomes were improvement in nerve function after two years, change in nerve pain and tenderness, and adverse events. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials and non‐randomised studies. Main results We included two RCTs involving 88 participants. The trials were at high risk of bias. The trials examined the added benefit of surgery over prednisolone for treatment of nerve damage of less than six months duration. After two years' follow‐up there was only very low quality evidence of no significant difference in nerve function improvement between participants treated with surgery plus prednisolone or with prednisolone alone. Adverse effects of decompressive surgery were not adequately described. Authors' conclusions Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage in leprosy but the available evidence from RCTs is of very low quality and does not show a significant added benefit of surgery over steroid treatment alone. Well‐designed RCTs are needed to establish the effectiveness of the combination of surgery and medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone. Plain language summary Decompressive surgery for treating nerve damage in leprosy Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease. Leprosy bacteria cause damage to skin and peripheral nerves which may result in nerve function impairment and disability. Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage although its effect is uncertain. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review and examined the added benefit of surgery over prednisolone for treatment of nerve damage of less than six months duration. Both trials were at high risk of bias. Two years from the start there was very low quality evidence of no significant difference in nerve function improvement between people treated with surgery plus prednisolone or with prednisolone alone. Adverse effects of decompressive surgery were not adequately described. No additional trials were identified when searches were updated in 2010 and 2012. Decompressive surgery is used for treating nerve damage in leprosy but the available evidence from RCTs is of very low quality and does not show a significant added benefit of surgery over steroid treatment alone.

CD009590.PUB2,"Abstract - Background This overview reports on interventions for pain relief and for subfertility in pre‐menopausal women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis. Objectives The objective of this overview was to summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on treatment options for women with pain or subfertility associated with endometriosis. Methods Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting pain or fertility outcomes in women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis were eligible for inclusion in the overview. We also identified Cochrane reviews in preparation (protocols and titles) for future inclusion. The reviews, protocols and titles were identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in March 2014. Pain‐related outcomes of the overview were pain relief, clinical improvement or resolution and pain recurrence. Fertility‐related outcomes were live birth, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage and adverse events. Selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE methods. Review findings were summarised in the text and the data for each outcome were reported in 'Additional tables'. Main results Seventeen systematic reviews published in  The Cochrane Library  were included. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. Limitations in the evidence included risk of bias in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies, and imprecision in effect estimates. Pain relief (14 reviews) Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues One systematic review reported low quality evidence of an overall benefit for GnRH analogues compared with placebo or no treatment. Ovulation suppression Five systematic reviews reported on medical treatment using ovulation suppression. There was moderate quality evidence that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUD) was more effective than expectant management, and very low quality evidence that danazol was more effective than placebo. There was no consistent evidence of a difference in effectiveness between oral contraceptives and goserelin, estrogen plus progestogen and placebo, or progestogens and placebo, though in all cases the relevant evidence was of low or very low quality. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) A review of NSAIDs reported inconclusive evidence of a benefit in symptom relief compared with placebo. Surgical interventions There were two reviews of surgical interventions. One reported moderate quality evidence of a benefit in pain relief following laparoscopic surgery compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only. The other reported very low quality evidence that recurrence rates of endometriomata were lower after excisional surgery than after ablative surgery. Post‐surgical medical interventions Two reviews reported on post‐surgical medical interventions. Neither found evidence of an effect on pain outcomes, though in both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine There were two systematic reviews of alternative medicine. One reported evidence of a benefit from auricular acupuncture compared to Chinese herbal medicine, and the other reported no evidence of a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and danazol. In both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Anti‐TNF‐α drugs One review found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between anti‐TNF‐α drugs and placebo. However, the evidence was of low quality. Reviews reporting fertility outcomes (8 reviews) Medical interventions Four reviews reported on medical interventions for improving fertility in women with endometriosis. One compared three months of GnRH agonists with a control in women undergoing assisted reproduction and found very low quality evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancies in the treatment group. There was no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between the interventions in the other three reviews, which compared GnRH agonists versus antagonists, ovulation suppression versus placebo or no treatment, and pre‐surgical medical therapy versus surgery alone. In all cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Surgical interventions Three reviews reported on surgical interventions. There was moderate quality evidence that both live births or ongoing pregnancy rates and clinical pregnancy rates were higher after laparoscopic surgery than after diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was low quality evidence of no difference in effectiveness between surgery and expectant management for endometrioma. One review found low quality evidence that excisional surgery resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates than drainage or ablation of endometriomata. Post‐surgical interventions Two reviews reported on post‐surgical medical interventions. They found no evidence of an effect on clinical pregnancy rates. The evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine A  review of Chinese herbal medicine in comparison with gestrinone found no evidence of a difference between the groups in clinical pregnancy rates. However, the evidence was of low quality. Adverse events Reviews of GnRH analogues and of danazol reported that the interventions were associated with higher rates of adverse effects than placebo; and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates of adverse events than other treatments. Chinese herbal medicine was associated with fewer side effects than gestrinone or danazol. Three reviews reported miscarriage as an outcome. No difference was found between surgical and diagnostic laparoscopy, between GnRH agonists and antagonists, or between aspiration of endometrioma and expectant management. However, in all cases the quality of the evidence was of low quality. Authors' conclusions For women with pain and endometriosis, suppression of menstrual cycles with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUD) and danazol were beneficial interventions. Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis and excision of endometriomata were also associated with improvements in pain. The evidence on NSAIDs was inconclusive. There was no evidence of benefit with post‐surgical medical treatment. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence on harms was scanty, but GnRH analogues, danazol and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates than other interventions. Plain language summary Endometriosis: an overview of Cochrane Reviews Background Cochrane review authors examined the evidence on endometriosis from Cochrane systematic reviews published in  The Cochrane Library . We aimed to summarise the evidence on treatment options that are available to women with pain or subfertility, or both, associated with clinically diagnosed endometriosis. Study characteristics We included 17 Cochrane systematic reviews. Fourteen reported measures of pain relief and eight reported fertility outcomes. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons and outcomes ranged from very low to moderate, due to limitations in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies and imprecision in the findings. Key results A number of interventions appeared effective in alleviating pain in women with endometriosis. These were gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues when compared with placebo, the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUD) compared with expectant management, danazol compared with placebo, and progestagens and anti‐progestagens compared with placebo. Laparoscopic surgical interventions also appeared to be effective for pain. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence on harms was scanty but GnRH analogues and danazol were associated with higher rates of adverse effects than placebo, and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates than other treatments.",Endometriosis: an overview of Cochrane Reviews,Brown and  J; Farquhar and  C,3,2,,
CD005953.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The EC/IC Bypass Study Group found no benefit of extracranial to intracranial (EC/IC) bypass surgery over medical therapy in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion (sCAO). However, the study was criticised for many reasons and the real effect of this treatment is still not known conclusively. Objectives To determine whether bypass surgery plus medical care is superior to medical care alone in patients with sCAO. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2009). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2009). We also searched ongoing trials and research registers, checked reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted colleagues, trial authors and researchers. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and non‐random studies of EC/IC bypass surgery plus best medical treatment compared with best medical treatment alone to prevent subsequent stroke, improve cerebral haemodynamics and reduce dependency after stroke. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, and extracted data items on the number of outcome events onto a data extraction form. We only analysed secondary outcomes if the study provided information on at least one primary outcome. We also used intention‐to‐treat analysis where possible. Main results We included 21 trials, including two RCTs, involving 2591 patients. For all endpoints, no benefit of EC/IC bypass surgery was shown either in the RCTs (any death: odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05, P = 0.11; stroke: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23, P = 0.91; death and dependency: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21, P = 0.64), or in the non‐RCTs (any death: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.62, P = 0.99; stroke: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.18, P = 0.25; death and dependency: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29, P = 0.37). Authors' conclusions EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with sCAO disease was neither superior nor inferior to medical care alone. However, most studies included patients irrespective of their cerebral haemodynamics. Participation in an ongoing RCT, which is restricted to patients with impaired haemodynamics, is recommended as these patients might benefit from bypass surgery. Plain language summary Extracranial‐intracranial arterial bypass surgery for occlusive carotid artery disease Patients with symptomatic occlusion (obstruction) of the carotid artery have a high risk of subsequent stroke. Anticoagulant treatment and antiplatelet agents are not very effective in these patients and a surgical procedure known as extracranial‐intracranial (EC/IC) arterial bypass surgery has been a treatment option. In this review, we included 21 trials (two randomised controlled trials and 19 non‐random studies, with a total of 2591 patients). We found that EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusive disease was no better or worse than medical care alone. A multi‐centre trial comparing EC/IC bypass surgery with best medical treatment in patients with both a high risk of stroke and haemodynamic compromise (impaired blood flow) is underway, and aims to discover whether EC/IC bypass surgery is beneficial in this specific group of patients.",Extracranial‐intracranial arterial bypass surgery for occlusive carotid artery disease,Fluri and  F; Engelter and  S; Lyrer and  P,3,2,,
CD004574.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Mallet finger, also called drop or baseball finger, is where the end of a finger cannot be actively straightened out due to injury of the extensor tendon mechanism. Treatment commonly involves splintage of the finger for six or more weeks. Less frequently, surgical fixation is used to correct the deformity. Objectives To examine the evidence for the relative effectiveness of different methods of treating mallet finger injuries. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March week 1 2008), EMBASE (1988 to 2008 week 11), other databases, reference lists of articles and various conference proceedings. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised clinical trials evaluating different interventions, including no intervention, for treating mallet finger injuries. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently performed study selection, quality assessment and data extraction. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Main results Four trials were included. These involved a total of 278, mainly adult, participants with 283 mallet finger injuries. All four trials were methodologically flawed, including inadequate outcome assessment. Three trials compared different types of finger splints versus a standard Stack splint. One trial found a lower incidence of treatment failure in participants treated with a perforated custom‐made splint. One trial found there were fewer complications in participants treated with a padded aluminium‐alloy malleable finger splint; however, the incidence of treatment failure was similar in the two treatment groups. One trial evaluating the Abouna splint found a similar incidence of treatment failure in the two groups. However, the Abouna splint often needed replacing due to disintegration of its rubber cover and rusting of the exposed wires and was also less popular with participants. The fourth trial found no statistically significant differences between participants whose mallet finger was treated with Kirschner wire fixation and those with a Pryor and Howard splint. Similar numbers had complications in the two groups. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different, either custom‐made or off‐the‐shelf, finger splints used for treating mallet finger injury. There was a useful reminder that splints used for prolonged immobilisation should be robust enough for everyday use, and of the central importance of patient adherence to instructions for splint use. There was insufficient evidence to determine when surgery is indicated. Plain language summary Interventions for treating mallet finger injuries Mallet finger, also called drop or baseball finger, is where the end of a finger cannot be actively straightened out due to injury. Typically the skin remains intact, and the impairment results from a tear of a finger tendon or a small fracture where the tendon attaches to the bone. Treatment commonly involves immobilising the finger‐end in a splint for six or more weeks. Surgery may be used for more severe injuries. Four randomised trials were included in the review. These involved a total of 278, mainly adult, participants with 283 mallet finger injuries. The methods of all four trials were flawed leading to concerns about bias. There was no pooling of data. Three trials compared different types of finger splints versus a standard Stack splint. One trial found less treatment failure in participants treated with a perforated custom‐made splint. A second trial found there were fewer complications in participants treated with a padded aluminium‐alloy malleable finger splint. However, the incidence of treatment failure was similar in the two treatment groups of this trial. The third trial evaluated the Abouna splint and found a similar incidence of treatment failure in the two groups. However, the Abouna splint often needed replacing due to disintegration of its rubber cover and rusting of the exposed wires and was also less popular with participants. The fourth trial in the review found no significant differences between participants whose mallet finger was treated with Kirschner wire fixation and those with a Pryor and Howard splint. Similar numbers had complications in the two groups. The review concluded that there was not enough evidence to show which is the best way to treat mallet finger injury. It noted, however, that splints used for prolonged immobilisation should be robust enough for everyday use.",Interventions for treating mallet finger injuries,Handoll and  HHG; Vaghela and  MV,2,3,,
CD013502,"Abstract - Background This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews of interventions for shoulder disorders. Objectives To synthesise the available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff tears of the shoulder. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICRTP registry unrestricted by date or language until 8 January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with full‐thickness rotator cuff tears and assessing the effect of rotator cuff repair compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other treatment were included. As there were no trials comparing surgery with placebo, the primary comparison was rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression versus non‐operative treatment (exercises with or without glucocorticoid injection). Other comparisons were rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty versus rotator cuff repair alone, and rotator cuff repair and subacromial decompression versus subacromial decompression alone. Major outcomes were mean pain, shoulder function, quality of life, participant‐rated global assessment of treatment success, adverse events and serious adverse events. The primary endpoint for this review was one year. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We included nine trials with 1007 participants. Three trials compared rotator cuff repair with subacromial decompression followed by exercises with exercise alone. These trials included 339 participants with full‐thickness rotator cuff tears diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound examination. One of the three trials also provided up to three glucocorticoid injections in the exercise group. All surgery groups received tendon repair with subacromial decompression and the postoperative exercises were similar to the exercises provided for the non‐operative groups. Five trials (526 participants) compared repair with acromioplasty versus repair alone; and one trial (142 participants) compared repair with subacromial decompression versus subacromial decompression alone. The mean age of trial participants ranged between 56 and 68 years, and females comprised 29% to 56% of the participants. Symptom duration varied from a mean of 10 months up to 28 months. Two trials excluded tears with traumatic onset of symptoms. One trial defined a minimum duration of symptoms of six months and required a trial of conservative therapy before inclusion. The trials included mainly repairable full‐thickness supraspinatus tears, six trials specifically excluded tears involving the subscapularis tendon. All trials were at risk of bias for several criteria, most notably due to lack of participant and personnel blinding, but also for other reasons such as unclearly reported methods of random sequence generation or allocation concealment (six trials), incomplete outcome data (three trials), selective reporting (six trials), and other biases (six trials). Our main comparison was rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression versus non‐operative treatment. We identified three trials for this comparison, that compared rotator cuff repair with subacromial decompression followed by exercises with exercise alone with or without glucocorticoid injections, and results are reported here for the 12 month follow up. At one year, moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) from 3 trials with 258 participants indicates that surgery probably provides little or no improvement in pain; mean pain (range 0 to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was 1.6 points with non‐operative treatment and 0.87 points better (0.43 better to 1.30 better) with surgery. Mean function (zero to 100, higher score indicating better outcome) was 72 points with non‐operative treatment and 6 points better (2.43 better to 9.54 better) with surgery (3 trials; 269 participants), low‐certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Participant‐rated global success rate was 48/55 after non‐operative treatment and 52/55 after surgery corresponding to risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.22; low‐certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Health‐related quality of life was 57.5 points (SF‐36 mental component score, 0 to 100, higher score indicating better quality of life) with non‐operative treatment and 1.3 points worse (4.5 worse to 1.9 better) with surgery (1 trial; 103 participants), low‐certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). We were unable to estimate the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events as only one event was reported across the trials (very low‐certainty evidence; downgraded once due to bias and twice due to very serious imprecision). Authors' conclusions At the moment, we are uncertain whether rotator cuff repair surgery provides clinically meaningful benefits to people with symptomatic tears; it may provide little or no clinically important benefits with respect to pain, function, overall quality of life or participant‐rated global assessment of treatment success when compared with non‐operative treatment. Surgery may not improve shoulder pain or function compared with exercises, with or without glucocorticoid injections. The trials included have methodology concerns and none included a placebo control. They included participants with mostly small degenerative tears involving the supraspinatus tendon and the conclusions of this review may not be applicable to traumatic tears, large tears involving the subscapularis tendon or young people. Furthermore, the trials did not assess if surgery could prevent arthritic changes in long‐term follow‐up. Further well‐designed trials in this area that include a placebo‐surgery control group and long follow‐up are needed to further increase certainty about the effects of surgery for rotator cuff tears. Plain language summary Does repair of torn rotator cuff tendons work? Review question To assess the effect of surgical repair of rotator cuff tendons on shoulder pain, function and other outcomes in adults with full‐thickness rotator cuff tears compared with non‐surgical management. Background The rotator cuff is a group of tendons that move the shoulder joint. Some people have pain in their shoulder related to wear and tear of the rotator cuff tendons. The weakening of the tendon is thought to be caused by aging and mechanical wear. Eventually, the process may result in a tear of the tendons. Rotator cuff tears can cause pain and impair arm function but asymptomatic tears also occur. For people with symptomatic tears, non‐operative management including pain medicines (simple analgesia and anti‐inflammatories), glucocorticoid injections and physical therapies do not always result in satisfactory outcomes. Surgery is usually considered when other treatments fail. Surgery includes removing part of the bone to broaden the tendon passage (subacromial decompression) and repair of the torn tendons. Sometimes the surgeons cannot repair the tendon due to the size of the tear or degeneration of the muscle, and in these cases only subacromial decompression may be performed. Most rotator cuff surgery is now performed arthroscopically (surgical instruments are inserted through small key holes to perform surgery) or through small incisions (mini‐open approach). Study characteristics This Cochrane Review is current to January 2019. We found nine trials with 1007 participants. Participants mean age was 56 to 68 years, and females comprised 29% to 56% of the participants. The participants had symptoms for several months or years and were diagnosed with a full‐thickness tear with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound examination. Studies were conducted in Finland, Norway, Canada, USA, France, the Netherlands, Italy and South Korea. Our primary analysis included three trials with 339 participants who received either surgery (tendon repair and removal of bone from undersurface of acromion) or non‐operative therapy (exercises with or without glucocorticoid injection). Three studies received funding however none of them reported using the funds directly for these trials. Key results Compared with non‐operative treatment, surgery resulted in little or no benefit in people with rotator cuff tears for up to one year. Pain (lower scores mean less pain)  Improved by 9% (4% better to 13% better) or 0.9 points on a zero to 10 scale • People who had non‐operative treatment rated their pain as 1.6 points • People who had surgery rated their pain as 0.7 points.  Function (0 to 100; higher scores mean better function) Improved by 6% (2% better to 10% better) or 6 points on a zero to 100 scale • People who had non‐operative treatment scored 72 points • People who had surgery scored 78 points Participant‐rate global treatment success (participants satisfied with the outcome)  7% more people rated their treatment a success (4% fewer to 13% more), or seven more people out of 100. • 48/55 (873/1000) of people considered treatment as successful with non‐operative treatment • 51/54 (943/1000) of people considered treatment as successful with surgery Overall quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life) Worsened 1% (4% worse to 2% better) or 1.3 points on a zero to 100 scale • People who had non‐operative treatment rated their quality of life 58 • People who had surgery (subacromial decompression) rated their quality of life 57 Adverse events  • One adverse event (frozen shoulder) was reported in the trials in exercise group. Thus, we are unable to estimate comparative risk. Serious adverse events  • No serious adverse events were reported in the trials.

CD005320.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Dislocation following hip replacement is associated with significant morbidity and functional cost. The cause is usually multifactorial. A variety of treatment options are available which can broadly be classified into operative and non‐operative. Objectives To determine the best methods of treatment of recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement. Search methods The following databases were searched until August 2006: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Health Technology Assessment database (HTA), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), and MetaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing operative and non‐operative treatments for recurrent dislocation following total hip replacement. Data collection and analysis Two independent reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to identified studies. Main results Searches identified 269 studies. None fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions The authors invite researchers to perform RCTs comparing different treatment options for recurrent dislocation of the hip. The heterogeneity of the population and variety of underlying causes would favour a multi‐centre study to achieve an adequate sample size. Plain language summary Treatments for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of treatments for dislocation of the hip after total hip replacement surgery. The review shows that: It is not known what the best treatment for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery is. This is because no evidence was found that looked at the treatments for dislocation of the hip after surgery. What are the treatments for dislocation of the hip after Total Hip Replacement surgery?   In total hip replacement surgery, the whole hip joint can be replaced by an artificial joint or hip. About 3 out of 100 people who have this surgery will dislocate their hip. Dislocating a hip causes much pain and other problems. There are many ways to fix a dislocated hip. Usually, the first time a dislocation occurs the hip is put into a cast or brace. But repeated dislocations usually need to be fixed with surgery. Unfortunately, the causes for dislocation are many and some are not known making it difficult to know the best way to fix it. What are the results of this review?   No evidence was found that looked at the treatments for dislocation of the hip after surgery.",Operative and non‐operative treatment options for dislocation of the hip following total hip arthroplasty,Khan and  RJK; Carey Smith and  RL; Alakeson and  R; Fick and  DP; Wood and  DJ,3,3,,
CD005304.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Tracheomalacia, a disorder of the large airways where the trachea is deformed or malformed during respiration, is commonly seen in tertiary paediatric practice. It is associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory symptoms from life‐threatening recurrent apnoea to common respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and wheeze. Current practice following diagnosis of tracheomalacia includes medical approaches aimed at reducing associated symptoms of tracheomalacia, ventilation modalities of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi‐level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and surgical approaches aimed at improving the calibre of the airway (airway stenting, aortopexy, tracheopexy). Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of medical and surgical therapies for children with intrinsic (primary) tracheomalacia. Search methods The Cochrane Airways Group searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The Cochrane Airways Group performed the latest searches in March 2012. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of therapies related to symptoms associated with primary or intrinsic tracheomalacia. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers extracted data from the included study independently and resolved disagreements by consensus. Main results We included one RCT that compared nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) with placebo in 40 children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection. We assessed it to be a RCT with overall low risk of bias. Data analysed in this review showed that there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of proportion cough‐free at two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 5.14). However, the mean change in night time cough diary scores significantly favoured the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.83, P = 0.02). The mean change in daytime cough diary scores from baseline was also better in the placebo group compared to those on nebulised rhDNase, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (MD 0.70; 95% CI ‐0.19 to 1.59). Other outcomes (dyspnoea, and difficulty in expectorating sputum scores, and lung function tests at two weeks also favoured placebo over nebulised rhDNase but did not reach levels of significance. Authors' conclusions There is currently an absence of evidence to support any of the therapies currently utilised for management of intrinsic tracheomalacia. It remains inconclusive whether the use of nebulised rhDNase in children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection worsens recovery. It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life‐threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia. For those with less severe disease, RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics and chest physiotherapy are clearly needed. Outcomes of these RCTs should include measurements of the trachea and physiological outcomes in addition to clinical outcomes. Plain language summary Interventions for primary (intrinsic) tracheomalacia in children The term malacia is derived from the Greek word 'malakia', meaning soft. In tracheomalacia, the walls of trachea (or windpipe) are softer than normal, which can lead to partial collapse (falling in) of the windpipe. This collapse usually happens when more air is needed, such as during exercise. The word 'primary' refers to tracheomalacia in which the windpipe itself is the cause of the disease, where as secondary tracheomalacia is compressed due to some other abnormality near to the windpipe. The most common symptom of tracheomalacia is expiratory stridor (high‐pitched wheezing sound). If the symptoms are severe enough, treatment such as mechanical ventilation, tracheal stenting (mesh tube inserted into windpipe to hold it open) or surgery may be needed. We wanted to find out which out of these possible treatments was most effective. We found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that assessed nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) which helps in breaking down the mucous and has been shown to be useful in aiding airway clearance in cystic fibrosis compared to placebo (no active treatment) in children with both tracheomalacia and a concurrent respiratory infection. This trial showed no evidence of benefit in terms of the number of children who were cough‐free two weeks after treatment. Also, there was less coughing reported, both during the day and at night, in the group who did not receive the intervention ‐ however these differences were not statistically significant. With the lack of evidence, the routine use of any therapies for intrinsic tracheomalacia cannot be recommended given the cost of nebulised rhDNase and the likely harmful effect. The decision to subject a child to any surgical or medical based therapies will have to be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the risk‐benefit ratio for each individual situation. It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life‐threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia. For those with less severe disease, RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics and chest physiotherapy are needed.",Interventions for primary (intrinsic) tracheomalacia in children,Goyal and  V; Masters and  IB; Chang and  AB,1,3,,
CD011392.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Pancreatic pseudocysts are walled‐off peripancreatic fluid collections. There is considerable uncertainty about how pancreatic pseudocysts should be treated. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of different management strategies for pancreatic pseudocysts. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in  The Cochrane Library  2015, Issue 9, and MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers until September 2015. We also searched the references of included trials and contacted trial authors. Selection criteria We only considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with pancreatic pseudocysts, regardless of size, presence of symptoms, or aetiology. We placed no restrictions on blinding, language, or publication status of the trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) with RevMan 5, based on an available‐case analysis for direct comparisons, using fixed‐effect and random‐effect models. We also conducted indirect comparisons (rather than network meta‐analysis), since there were no outcomes for which direct and indirect evidence were available. Main results We included four RCTs, with 177 participants, in this review. After one participant was excluded, 176 participants were randomised to endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)‐guided drainage (88 participants), endoscopic drainage (44 participants), EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage (24 participants), and open surgical drainage (20 participants). The comparisons included endoscopic drainage versus EUS‐guided drainage (two trials), EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage versus EUS‐guided drainage alone (one trial), and open surgical drainage versus EUS‐guided drainage (one trial). The participants were mostly symptomatic, with pancreatic pseudocysts resulting from acute and chronic pancreatitis of varied aetiology. The mean size of the pseudocysts ranged between 70 mm and 155 mm across studies. Although the trials appeared to include similar types of participants for all comparisons, we were unable to assess this statistically, since there were no direct and indirect results for any of the comparisons. All the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. One death occurred in the endoscopic drainage group (1/44; 2.3%), due to bleeding. There were no deaths in the other groups. The differences in the serious adverse events were imprecise. Short‐term health‐related quality of life (HRQoL; four weeks to three months) was worse (MD ‐21.00; 95% CI ‐33.21 to ‐8.79; participants = 40; studies = 1; range: 0 to 100; higher score indicates better) and the costs were higher in the open surgical drainage group than the EUS‐guided drainage group (MD 8040 USD; 95% CI 3020 to 13,060; participants = 40; studies = 1). There were fewer adverse events in the EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage group than in the EUS‐guided drainage alone (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.73; participants = 47; studies = 1), or the endoscopic drainage group (indirect comparison: OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61). Participants with EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage also had shorter hospital stays compared to EUS‐guided drainage alone (MD ‐8.10 days; 95% CI ‐9.79 to ‐6.41; participants = 47; studies = 1), endoscopic drainage (indirect comparison: MD ‐7.10 days; 95% CI ‐9.38 to ‐4.82), or open surgical drainage group (indirect comparison: MD ‐12.30 days; 95% CI ‐14.48 to ‐10.12). The open surgical drainage group had longer hospital stays than the EUS‐guided drainage group (MD 4.20 days; 95% CI 2.82 to 5.58; participants = 40; studies = 1); the endoscopic drainage group had longer hospital stays than the open drainage group (indirect comparison: ‐5.20 days; 95% CI ‐7.26 to ‐3.14). The need for additional invasive interventions was higher for the endoscopic drainage group than the EUS‐guided drainage group (OR 11.13; 95% CI 2.85 to 43.44; participants = 89; studies = 2), and the open drainage group (indirect comparison: OR 23.69; 95% CI 1.40 to 400.71). The differences between groups were imprecise for the other comparisons that could be performed. None of the trials reported long‐term mortality, medium‐term HRQoL (three months to one year), long‐term HRQoL (longer than one year), time‐to‐return to normal activities, or time‐to‐return to work. Authors' conclusions Very low‐quality evidence suggested that the differences in mortality and serious adverse events between treatments were imprecise. Low‐quality evidence suggested that short‐term HRQoL (four weeks to three months) was worse, and the costs were higher in the open surgical drainage group than in the EUS‐guided drainage group. Low‐quality or very low‐quality evidence suggested that EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage led to fewer adverse events than EUS‐guided or endoscopic drainage, and shorter hospital stays when compared to EUS‐guided drainage, endoscopic drainage, or open surgical drainage, while EUS‐guided drainage led to shorter hospital stays than open surgical drainage. Low‐quality evidence suggested that there was a higher need for additional invasive procedures with endoscopic drainage than EUS‐guided drainage, while it was lower in the open surgical drainage than in the endoscopic drainage group. Further RCTs are needed to compare EUS‐guided drainage, with or without nasocystic drainage, in symptomatic patients with pancreatic pseudocysts that require treatment. Future trials should include patient‐oriented outcomes such as mortality, serious adverse events, HRQoL, hospital stay, return‐to‐normal activity, number of work days lost, and the need for additional procedures, for a minimum follow‐up period of two to three years. Plain language summary Treatment methods for people with pancreatic pseudocysts (fluid collections around the pancreas) Review question How should people with pancreatic pseudocysts be treated? Background The pancreas is an abdominal organ that secretes several digestive enzymes (substances that enable and speed up chemical reactions in the body) into the pancreatic ductal system, which empties into the small bowel. It also contains the Islets of Langerhans, which secrete several hormones, including insulin (that helps to regulate blood sugar). Pancreatic pseudocysts are fluid collections around the pancreas. They arise due to sudden or long‐standing inflammation of the pancreas. While some will disappear when the inflammation of the pancreas settles down, others remain and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, indigestion, vomiting, and weight loss. Treatments of pancreatic pseudocysts include conservative treatment (watchful monitoring), surgical drainage, which can be performed through a standard cut (open surgical drainage) or by key‐hole surgery (laparoscopic surgical drainage), or endoscopic drainage. In endoscopic drainage, a tube (stent) is inserted with the help of an endoscope (a tube passed through the mouth into the stomach, usually to visualise the abdominal organs from inside the body), that connects the pseudocyst to the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. The insertion may be further helped by using an endoscopic ultrasound (an ultrasound probe attached to the endoscope; EUS‐guided drainage). Endoscopic ultrasound‐guided drainage may be further assisted by passing a tube through the nose and inserting it into the cyst during EUS‐guided drainage (EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage). The best way to treat pancreatic pseudocysts is not clear. We sought to resolve this by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all randomised controlled trials whose results were reported up to 8 September 2015. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time (direct comparison), we used advanced methods, which allow individual comparison of the different treatments compared in the trials (indirect comparison). Study characteristics We included four trials, with 177 participants, in the review, 176 of whom were included in the analyses. The treatments compared in the four trials included endoscopic drainage (without EUS guidance), EUS‐guided drainage, EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage, and open surgical drainage. The participants were mostly people with pancreatic pseudocysts resulting from sudden onset or long‐term inflammation of the pancreas, from different causes. Key results One death occurred in the endoscopic drainage group, due to bleeding. The differences in the serious complications were imprecise. Short‐term health‐related quality of life (HRQoL; four weeks to three months) was worse, and the costs were higher in the open surgical drainage group than in the EUS‐guided drainage group. There were fewer complications of any severity (such as bleeding) that required additional treatment in the EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage group than in the EUS‐guided drainage alone or endoscopic drainage groups. Those who received EUS‐guided drainage with nasocystic drainage also had a shorter hospital stay compared to those who received EUS‐guided drainage alone, endoscopic drainage, or open surgical drainage. Those who received EUS‐guided drainage alone had shorter hospital stays than those with open surgical drainage. There was a higher need for additional invasive treatments to completely drain the pseudocyst with endoscopic drainage than EUS‐guided drainage alone. The differences for the other comparisons were imprecise. None of the trials reported long‐term deaths, medium‐term or long‐term HRQoL, time‐to‐return to normal activities, or time‐to‐return to work.

CD013678.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Lamellar macular holes (LMHs) are small, partial‐thickness defects of the macula defined by characteristic features on optical coherence tomography (OCT), including a newly recognised type of epiretinal membrane termed ‘epiretinal proliferation’. There may be a rationale to recommend surgery for individuals with LMHs, particularly those with functional or anatomical deterioration, or poor baseline vision causing significant disability, to stabilise the LMH and prevent further visual deterioration; however, there is currently no evidence‐based consensus. Objectives To assess the effect of surgical interventions on post‐operative visual and anatomical outcomes in people with a confirmed LMH. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Scopus SciVerse, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched reference lists of included trials to identify other eligible trials which our search strategy may have missed. The date of the search was 20 July 2021. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants with a confirmed LMH diagnosis which reported one or more surgical intervention(s), alone or in combination, in at least one arm of the RCT. Data collection and analysis We used standard methods as expected by Cochrane. Two study authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for included trials. Trial authors were contacted for further information and clarification. Main results A single RCT was eligible for inclusion. Thirty‐six participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio; 24 were allocated to undergo surgery (pars plana vitrectomy, peeling of the epiretial proliferation followed by fovea‐sparing removal of the internal limiting membrane) and 12 (10 following two participant dropouts) to observation. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes due to selection and detection bias, and the low number of participants enrolled in the study which may affect the accuracy of results and reliability of conclusions. At six‐month follow‐up, change in vision was better in the surgery group (‐0.27 logMAR improvement) than observation (0.02 worsening) (mean difference (MD): ‐0.29 logMAR, 95% confidence intervals (CI): ‐0.33 to ‐0.25). Central retinal thickness increased in the surgery group over 6 months 126 μm increase) compared with observation group (decrease by 11μm) (MD: 137 μm, 95% CI: 125.87 μm to 148.13 μm). Finally, at six‐month follow‐up, retinal sensitivity was better in the surgery group (3.03 dB increase) compared with the observation group (0.06 dB decrease) (MD: 3.09 dB, 95% CI: 2.07 to 4.11 dB). Vision‐related quality of life and metamorphopsia were not reported. No adverse outcomes or complications were reported in the study, however, authors could not provide information on whether any individuals developed deterioration in vision of 0.2 logMAR or worse. Authors' conclusions The included single trial demonstrated improvements in visual and anatomical outcome measures for participants with a LMH who underwent surgery compared with observation only. Therefore, we can conclude that participants who undergo surgery may achieve superior post‐operative best corrected visual acuity and anatomical outcomes compared with observation only. However, the results of a single and small RCT provides limited evidence to support or refute surgery as an effective management option for LMHs. Future RCTs with a larger number of participants and with fewer methodological limitations and biases are necessary to inform future clinical practice. Plain language summary The effectiveness of surgery for treating lamellar macular holes Why is this question important? Lamellar macular holes are small partial‐thickness defects affecting the centre of the retina, called the macula. The retina is the layer at the back of the eye that detects light, and the macula is essential for detailed vision. It has been suggested that surgery can prevent vision loss (or improve vision) in people with lamellar macular holes, but there is no current consensus. We reviewed published research to determine whether surgery improves vision for people with a lamellar macular hole. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We then planned to compare the results, and summarise the evidence from the studies. Finally, we then aimed to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and how similar the findings of the different studies were. What did we find? We found one study that involved a total of 36 people with a diagnosis of a lamellar macular hole. This study showed that people who underwent surgery may achieve better vision six months after their surgery compared with people who were observed without receiving surgery. However, limitations in the study design and its small size means that our confidence in the evidence was low. What does this mean? It remains unclear whether surgery is effective for people with lamellar macular holes. Further research is required. How up‐to‐date is this review? The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 20 July 2021.",Surgical interventions for lamellar macular holes,Murphy and  DC; Rees and  J; Steel and  DHW,2,3,,
CD013238.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Glioblastoma is an uncommon but highly aggressive type of brain tumour. Significant gains have been achieved in the molecular understanding and the pathogenesis of glioblastomas, however clinical improvements are difficult to obtain for many reasons. The current standard of care involves maximal safe surgical resection followed by chemoradiation and then adjuvant chemotherapy European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the NCIC Clinical Trials Group (EORTC‐NCIC) protocol with a median survival of 14.6 months. Successive phase III international randomised controlled studies have failed to significantly demonstrate survival advantage with newer drugs. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is observed to be aberrant in 30% to 60% of glioblastomas. The receptor aberrancy is driven by abnormal gene amplification, receptor mutation, or both, in particular the extracellular vIII domain. EGFR abnormalities are common in solid tumours, and the advent of anti‐EGFR therapies in non‐small cell lung cancer and colorectal adenocarcinomas have greatly improved clinical outcomes. Anti‐EGFR therapies have been investigated amongst glioblastomas, however questions remain about its ongoing role in glioblastoma management. This review aimed to report on the available evidence to date and perform a systematic analysis on the risks and benefits of use of anti‐EGFR therapies in glioblastomas. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and harms of anti‐EGFR therapies for glioblastoma in adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, EBM Reviews databases, with supplementary handsearches to identify all available and relevant studies to 20 April 2020. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using anti‐EGFR therapies in adults with glioblastoma were eligible for inclusion. Anti‐EGFR therapies included tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, or vaccines. The comparison included investigational product added to standard of care versus standard of care or placebo, or investigational product against standard of care or placebo. Data collection and analysis The authorship team screened the search results and recorded the extracted data for analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodology to performed quantitative meta‐analysis if two or more studies had appropriate and available data. Otherwise, we conducted a qualitative and descriptive analysis. We used the GRADE system to rate the certainty of the evidence. The analysis was performed along the two clinical settings: first‐line (after surgery) and recurrent disease (after failure of first line treatment). Where information was available, we documented overall survival, progression‐free survival, adverse events, and quality of life data from eligible studies. Main results The combined searches initially identified 912 records (after removal of duplicates), and further screening resulted in 19 records for full consideration. We identified nine eligible studies for inclusion in the review. There were three first‐line studies and six recurrent studies. Five studies used tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); two studies used monoclonal antibodies; and two studies used targeted vaccines. More recent studies presented greater detail in the conduct of their studies and thus had a lower risk of bias. We observed no evidence benefit in overall survival with the use of anti‐EGFR therapy in the first‐line or recurrent setting (hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.04; 3 RCTs, 1000 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence; and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.21, 4 RCTs, 489 participants, low‐certainty evidence, respectively). All the interventions were generally well tolerated with low‐certainty evidence for lymphopenia (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.81; 4 RCTs, 1146 participants), neutropenia (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.03; 4 RCTs, 1146 participants), and thrombocytopenia (OR 3.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 26.51; 4 RCTs, 1146 participants). A notable toxicity relates to ABT‐414, where significant ocular issues were detected. The addition of anti‐EGFR therapy showed no evidence of an increase in progression‐free survival (PFS) in the first‐line setting (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.10; 2 RCTs, 894 participants, low‐certainty evidence). In the recurrent setting, there was an increase in PFS with the use of anti‐EGFR therapy (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96, 3 RCTs, 275 participants, low‐certainty evidence). The available quality of life assessment data showed that anti‐EGFR therapies were neither detrimental or beneficial when compared to standard care (not estimable). Authors' conclusions In summary, there is no evidence of a demonstrable overall survival benefit with the addition of anti‐EGFR therapy in first‐line and recurrent glioblastomas. Newer drugs that are specially designed for glioblastoma targets may raise the possibility of success in this population, but data are lacking at present. Future studies should be more selective in pursuing people displaying specific EGFR targets. Plain language summary Drugs that target abnormal growth protein in high‐grade, aggressive brain tumours Background Glioblastomas are highly aggressive brain tumours. They often appear quickly with devastating effects depending on the part of the brain they are located. They often affect previously well and high functioning individuals without any ‘warning signs’. There are no known risk factors. The impact on people with glioblastomas, their family, friends, and society is highly problematic. Standard therapy involves resection of the tumour, then combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by an additional six months of chemotherapy. This strategy aims only to control and contain the disease and delay its return because at present there is no cure. Researchers have investigated and found multiple gene changes in glioblastoma tissue samples, leading to clinical trials testing new drug therapies. The protein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which normally controls cell growth, is abnormal in glioblastomas in about 30% to 60% of cases. This abnormality can lead to unrestrained cell growth, replication, and an increase in the cancer's aggressive potential. It is currently recognised that people with glioblastomas with an abnormal EGFR may have shorter survivals. Some clinical trials with drugs targeting this protein have been conducted. This review aimed to collect all available evidence and investigate the risks and benefits for this type of therapy in glioblastomas, and in particular whether anti‐EGFR drugs can improve survival whilst remaining a tolerable therapy without side effects. Methods We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) that used anti‐EGFR therapies in people with glioblastoma up to April 2020. Key results Overall, no benefits were seen in improving overall survival with the use of anti‐EGFR therapy in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma or in the recurrent setting. The use of anti‐EGFR therapies was not associated with increased side effects such as low white cells or platelet counts. There were some expected side effects including skin rashes and diarrhoea, but these were not severe and did not seem to impact participant quality of life. Anti‐EGFR therapy did not delay disease worsening in newly diagnosed people with glioblastomas but there was an improvement seen amongst those with recurrent disease. Conclusions At present, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anti‐EGFR therapy in newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma. Whilst the therapy is in general expected as with other anti‐EGFR therapies, significant eye side effects can arise with ABT‐414. Overall, anti‐EGFR therapies did not appear to affect quality of life. The future use of anti‐EGFR therapy in the management of glioblastoma requires more investigation. Future research should be promoted and tailored towards people with glioblastoma with known abnormal EGFR receptors.",Anti‐epidermal growth factor receptor therapy for glioblastoma in adults,Lee and  A; Arasaratnam and  M; Chan and  DLok Hang; Khasraw and  M; Howell and  VM; Wheeler and  H,2,3,,
CD000522.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Many different surgical techniques have been described for the internal fixation of extracapsular hip fractures. Objectives To compare different aspects of surgical technique used in operations for internal fixation of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library  2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Controlled Trials, orthopaedic journals, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. Date of last search was January 2008. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria All randomised and quasi‐randomised trials investigating operative techniques used in operations for the treatment of extracapsular hip fractures in adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Wherever appropriate, data were pooled. Main results Predominantly older people with trochanteric fractures were treated in the 11 included trials. One trial (65 participants undergoing fixation with a fixed nail‐plate) found no statistically significant differences between osteotomy versus anatomical reduction.   Four trials, involving 465 participants undergoing fixation with a sliding hip screw (SHS), compared osteotomy versus anatomical reduction. Osteotomy was associated with an increased operative blood loss and length of surgery. There were no statistically significant differences for mortality, morbidity or measures of anatomical deformity. Two trials (138 participants) compared SHS fixation of a trochanteric hip fracture augmented with cement against a standard fixation. There were no reoperations even for the four cases of fixation failure in the cement group. The cement group had significantly better quality of life scores at six months. One trial (200 participants) comparing compression versus no compression of a trochanteric fracture in conjunction with SHS fixation found no significant differences between the two groups. One trial (120 participants) found a tendency to improved outcomes with a hydroxyapatite coated lag screw, but none reached statistical significance. One trial (19 participants) reported reduced temperatures when using a modified reaming method. Another trial (50 participants) found reduced bone marrow intravascular embolism, detected by oesophageal ultrasound, when a Gamma nail was inserted with a distal pressure venting hole in the femur. Authors' conclusions There is inadequate evidence to support the use of osteotomy for internal fixation of a trochanteric hip fracture. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the other techniques examined in the trials included in this review. Plain language summary Surgical techniques for fixing extracapsular hip fractures in adults Roughly half of all hip fractures are outside the hip joint capsule (extracapsular proximal femoral fractures). Many of these will be fixed or stabilised using metal implants which are a combination of screws, rods and plates attached to the thigh bone. Various techniques such as the selective removal of bone (osteotomy), the pressing together of bone fragments (compression), the addition of bone cement, and methods for insertion of nails such as reaming, are used during surgery. This review included 11 randomised or quasi‐randomised trials. The majority of the participants were female, usually aged around 80 years. There were seven comparisons but the evidence for each of these was insufficient to draw conclusions. Thus, the review found that there was too little evidence from randomised trials to show which, if any, specific surgical techniques used during operations for extracapsular proximal femoral fractures are better.","Osteotomy, compression and other modifications of surgical techniques for internal fixation of extracapsular hip fractures",Parker and  MJ; Handoll and  HHG,2,3,,
CD009496.PUB2,"Abstract - Background The morbidity and socioeconomic costs associated with long bone healing are considerable. Platelet‐rich therapies are autologous blood products with a greater concentration of platelets than physiological whole blood. Despite promising results from a number of  in‐vitro  animal studies, clinical evidence to support the use of platelet‐rich therapy in long bone healing is unclear. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits or harms) of platelet‐rich therapies for treating long bone osteotomies, acute fractures, un‐united fractures and defects in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (8 November 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library,  2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 1 2011) and EMBASE (1980 to Week 44 2011). Trial registers and reference lists of articles were also searched. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating any type of platelet‐rich therapy compared with either no additional treatment or a placebo in the management of long bone osteotomies, acute fractures, un‐united fractures and defects in adults. Studies including participants over 18 years of age; reporting functional outcomes, time to union, non‐union, secondary procedures such as for fixation failure or delayed or non‐union, adverse effects, pain or costs were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected the studies for inclusion in the review. Studies were assessed for the risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. Treatment effects for dichotomous outcomes were expressed with risk ratios (RR) and continuous measures with mean differences, together with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Only one eligible study, involving 21 participants, was included. The study compared platelet‐rich therapy and allogenic bone graft with allogenic bone graft alone in patients undergoing corrective osteotomy for medial compartment osteoarthrosis of the knee. The risk of bias associated with this study was substantial. There was no significant difference in patient‐reported or clinician‐assessed functional outcome scores between groups at one year. There was a statistically significant benefit from platelet‐rich therapy in the proportion of bones that were united at one year (8/9 versus 3/9; RR 2.67; 95% CI 1.03 to 6.91). This benefit, however, was not maintained when assuming poor outcomes for participants who were lost to follow‐up (8/11 versus 3/10; RR 2.42; 95% CI 0.88 to 6.68). One adverse event was reported in a participant receiving platelet‐rich therapy. One other eligible study involving hip fracture patients is currently underway. Authors' conclusions While a potential benefit of platelet‐rich therapies to augment long bone healing in adults cannot be ruled out, the currently available evidence from a single trial is insufficient to support the routine use of this intervention in clinical practice. Future trials should focus on reporting patient‐reported functional outcomes from all trial participants for a minimum follow‐up of one year. Plain language summary Platelet rich therapies for long bone healing in adult Broken bones (fractures) are a major cause of disability in adults. The time taken for a bone to heal (achieve 'union') is an important factor in determining recovery after an injury. A minority of fractures fail to heal at all or in an appropriate period of time. This review set out to find out whether treatment with platelet rich therapy (PRT) accelerates bone healing and reduces complications. Typically, platelet treatment involves the donation of a single venous blood sample from which the active, platelet‐rich, fraction is extracted usually by a process of centrifugation. Additional chemicals may be added to the active fraction to alter its biological and material handling properties. Only one study, involving 21 participants, was included in this review. The study compared PRT and bone graft versus bone graft alone (control) in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who had surgery where a wedge of bone was cut (osteotomy) from their tibia (shin bone) in order to change the pattern of weight bearing on the knee. As in a fracture, the time for the bone to heal is an important factor in determining recovery after an osteotomy. The study found no difference between the PRT and control groups in patient‐reported or clinician‐assessed functional outcomes at one year. However, based on radiographic (x‐ray) measures of bone healing, the study found a higher proportion of bones had healed by one year in those participants who had completed the study. One adverse event was reported in a participant receiving platelet‐rich therapy From the limited evidence that is currently available, the review found that PRT had no effect on functional outcomes. PRT may be beneficial in accelerating and improving the incidence of union in osteotomies. The only complication reported was not necessarily related to the PRT treatment. No data were available regarding PRT in the treatment of acute fractures, non‐united fractures or large bony defects. One other study involving hip fracture patients is currently underway, and will provide further evidence concerning the use of PRT in the future.",Platelet rich therapies for long bone healing in adults,Griffin and  XL; Wallace and  D; Parsons and  N; Costa and  ML,2,3,,
CD003943.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Children with cerebral palsy can be significantly disabled in terms of their ability to suck, chew and swallow. This can lead to significant impairment in feeding and, eventually, to undernutrition. It can also result in aspiration of food into the lungs. Length of feeding time may be considerably increased and, instead of being an enjoyable experience, mealtimes may be distressing for both child and carer. For children unable to maintain a normal nutritional state feeding by mouth, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes are increasingly being used to provide the digestive system with nutrients. A gastrostomy tube is a feeding tube inserted surgically through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach. A jejunostomy feeding tube is inserted into the jejunum, part of the small intestine, either directly or via a previous gastrostomy. Although gastrostomy or jejunostomy placement may greatly facilitate the feeding of children with cerebral palsy, many carers find it very emotionally difficult to accept this intervention. Moreover, the intervention is costly and there is the possibility of complications. The effectiveness and safety of the treatment requires further assessment. This review is an update of one previously published in 2004. Objectives To assess the effects of nutritional supplementation given via gastrostomy or jejunostomy to children with feeding difficulties due to cerebral palsy. Search methods For this update, we searched the following databases in July 2012: CENTRAL, MEDLINE , Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, LILACS and Zetoc. We searched for trials in ICTRP and Clinicaltrials.gov, and for theses in WorldCat and Proquest Index to Theses. We also contacted other researchers and experts in this field. Selection criteria We looked for randomised controlled trials that compared delivery of nutrition via a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube compared with oral feeding alone for children up to the age of 16 years. Data collection and analysis Screening of search results was undertaken independently by two review authors. No data extraction was possible as there were no included studies. Main results No trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions Considerable uncertainty about the effects of gastrostomy for children with cerebral palsy remains. A well designed and conducted randomised controlled trial should be undertaken to resolve the current uncertainties about medical management for children with cerebral palsy and physical difficulties in eating. Plain language summary Feeding by tube into the stomach or intestine versus feeding by mouth for children with cerebral palsy Children with cerebral palsy can have problems with sucking, chewing and swallowing. This can make it difficult to eat and lead eventually to undernutrition or problems caused by food going down the wrong way and getting into the lungs. Mealtimes may be long and distressing for the child and for their carer. Increasingly, feeding by a surgically‐inserted tube into the stomach (gastrostomy) or via a tube inserted into the middle of the small intestine (jejunostomy) is used to provide such children with nutrition. These processes can be costly, as well as being emotionally difficult for families, and complications are possible. We searched 12 databases in July 2012 but did not find any studies that randomly put children into two groups to investigate the effects of tube feeding via gastrostomy (or jejunostomy) compared to feeding by mouth only. Well‐designed studies are needed to help medical professionals and families make difficult decisions about how to treat children with cerebral palsy and physical difficulties in eating.",Gastrostomy feeding versus oral feeding alone for children with cerebral palsy,Gantasala and  S; Sullivan and  PB; Thomas and  AG,2,3,,
CD013405.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a challenge and burden to individuals and healthcare systems. The number of hip fractures globally is rising. The majority of extracapsular hip fractures are treated surgically. Objectives To assess the relative effects (benefits and harms) of all surgical treatments used in the management of extracapsular hip fractures in older adults, using a network meta‐analysis of randomised trials, and to generate a hierarchy of interventions according to their outcomes. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and five other databases in July 2020. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing different treatments for fragility extracapsular hip fractures in older adults. We included internal and external fixation, arthroplasties and non‐operative treatment. We excluded studies of hip fractures with specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or resulting from high‐energy trauma. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author completed data extraction which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for three outcomes at different time points: mortality and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) ‐ both reported within 4 months, at 12 months and after 24 months of surgery, and unplanned return to theatre (at end of study follow‐up). We performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA) with Stata software, using frequentist methods, and calculated the differences between treatments using risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also performed direct comparisons using the same codes. Main results We included 184 studies (160 RCTs and 24 quasi‐RCTs) with 26,073 participants with 26,086 extracapsular hip fractures in the review. The mean age in most studies ranged from 60 to 93 years, and 69% were women. After discussion with clinical experts, we selected nine nodes that represented the best balance between clinical plausibility and efficiency of the networks: fixed angle plate (dynamic and static), cephalomedullary nail (short and long), condylocephalic nail, external fixation, hemiarthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty (THA) and non‐operative treatment. Seventy‐three studies (with 11,126 participants) with data for at least two of these treatments contributed to the NMA. We selected the dynamic fixed angle plate as a reference treatment against which other treatments were compared. This was a common treatment in the networks, providing a clinically appropriate comparison.  We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious and very serious risks of bias, and because some of the estimates included the possibility of transitivity owing to the proportion of stable and unstable fractures between treatment comparisons. We also downgraded if we noted evidence of inconsistency in direct or indirect estimates from which the network estimate was derived. Most estimates included the possibility of benefits and harms, and we downgraded the evidence for these treatments for imprecision.  Overall, 20.2% of participants who received the reference treatment had died by 12 months after surgery. We noted no evidence of any differences in mortality at this time point between the treatments compared. Effect estimates of all treatments included plausible benefits as well as harms. Short cephalomedullary nails had the narrowest confidence interval (CI), with 7 fewer deaths (26 fewer to 15 more) per 1000 participants, compared to the reference treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.07). THA had the widest CI, with 62 fewer deaths (177 fewer to 610 more) per 1000 participants, compared to the reference treatment (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.03). The certainty of the evidence for all treatments was low to very low. Although we ranked the treatments, this ranking should be interpreted cautiously because of the imprecision in all the network estimates for these treatments. Overall, 4.3% of participants who received the reference treatment had unplanned return to theatre. Compared to this treatment, we found very low‐certainty evidence that 58 more participants (14 to 137 more) per 1000 participants returned to theatre if they were treated with a static fixed angle plate (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.50), and 91 more participants (37 to 182 more) per 1000 participants returned to theatre if treated with a condylocephalic nail (RR 3.33, 95% CI 1.95 to 5.68). We also found that these treatments were ranked as having the highest probability of unplanned return to theatre. In the remaining treatments, we noted no evidence of any differences in unplanned return to theatre, with effect estimates including benefits as well as harms. The certainty of the evidence for these other treatments ranged from low to very low. We did not use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for early mortality, but our findings were similar to those for 12‐month mortality, with no evidence of any differences in treatments when compared to dynamic fixed angle plate. Very few studies reported HRQoL and we were unable to build networks from these studies and perform network meta‐analysis.  Authors' conclusions Across the networks, we found that there was considerable variability in the ranking of each treatment such that there was no one outstanding, or subset of outstanding, superior treatments. However, static implants such as condylocephalic nails and static fixed angle plates did yield a higher risk of unplanned return to theatre. We had insufficient evidence to determine the effects of any treatments on HRQoL, and this review includes data for only two outcomes. More detailed pairwise comparisons of some of the included treatments are reported in other Cochrane Reviews in this series. Short cephalomedullary nails versus dynamic fixed angle plates contributed the most evidence to each network, and our findings indicate that there may be no difference between these treatments. These data included people with both stable and unstable extracapsular fractures. At this time, there are too few studies to draw any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of arthroplasty or external fixation for extracapsular fracture in older adults. Future research could focus on the benefits and harms of arthroplasty interventions compared with internal fixation using a dynamic implant. Plain language summary Which are the best treatments for hip fractures in older adults? Key messages ‐ There is no 'best treatment' for this type of broken hip.  ‐ More people needed additional surgery on their broken hip after treatment with condylocephalic nails (where a nail is inserted upwards from the knee towards the hip joint) or static fixed angle plates (where pins or screws attach a plate to the broken bone).   ‐ There may be no difference between a short cephalomedullary nail (where a nail is inserted downwards from the hip joint towards the knee) and a dynamic fixed angle plate (where the pins or screws attaching a plate to the broken bone are able to slide in a sleeve).  ‐ We found too few studies to know whether any of these treatments were better at improving people's quality of life after surgery. Hip fractures in older people A hip fractures is a break at the top of the leg bone. There are two types of hip fractures; in this review, we included people with a break just outside the hip joint. The other type of hip fracture is a break just below the ball and socket joint ‐ we reviewed these fractures in another review. Both types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. What are the treatments? ‐ Using metal implants to fix the broken parts of the bone. A nail is inserted inside the thigh bone. These long or short nails may be inserted downwards from the hip joint towards the knee (cephalomedullary nails). Some nails may be inserted upwards from the knee towards the hip joint (condylocephalic nail). Alternatively, the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins. Often the screws for these plates slide in a sleeve and the plate is called a dynamic fixed angle plate. Without this, it is a static fixed angle plate. ‐ Replacing the broken hip with an artificial one. This can be done using a hemiarthroplasty (HA), which replaces only the ball part of the joint, or with a total hip arthroplasty (THA) which replaces all of the hip joint including the socket. ‐ Using external fixation. Pins or screws are placed into the bones around the fracture and a metal frame holds these nails in place. The frame sits outside the body, around the broken hip. ‐ Treatment without an operation, usually requiring a period of rest in bed whilst the leg is held in position using traction with weights. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. We combined the findings from studies, and created a 'network' (which is used when researchers compare all available treatments in a single analysis called a 'network meta‐analysis') to see if we could find out if some treatments were better than others. What did we find? We found 184 studies with 26,073 people who had this type of hip fracture. Most people were aged between 60 and 93 years, and 69% were women, which is usual for people with this type of broken bone. We included 73 of these studies in our 'network'. We found little or no difference in how many people died with each treatment. We were not sure whether any of the treatments were better than another at reducing deaths within 12 months of surgery.  For most treatments, we also found little or no difference in whether",Surgical interventions for treating extracapsular hip fractures in older adults: a network meta‐analysis,Lewis and  SR; Macey and  R; Lewis and  J; Stokes and  J; Gill and  JR; Cook and  JA; Eardley and  WGP; Parker and  MJ; Griffin and  XL,2,3,,
CD010349.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Patients with newly diagnosed high‐risk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL) still have a poor outcome, despite multi‐modality intensive therapy. This poor outcome necessitates the search for new therapies, such as treatment with  131 I‐meta‐iodobenzylguanidine ( 131 I‐MIBG). Objectives To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1945 to 25 April 2016) and Embase (Ovid) (1980 to 25 April 2016). In addition, we handsearched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We also assessed the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology, Advances in Neuroblastoma Research and the American Society of Clinical Oncology; all from 2010 up to and including 2015. We scanned the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Register (www.isrctn.com) and the National Institutes of Health Register for ongoing trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) on 13 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), non‐randomised single‐arm trials with historical controls and cohort studies examining the efficacy of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in 10 or more patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results We identified two eligible cohort studies including 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. All studies had methodological limitations, with regard to both internal (risk of bias) and external validity. As the studies were not comparable with regard to prognostic factors and treatment (and often used different outcome definitions), pooling of results was not possible. In one study, the objective response rate (ORR) was 73% after surgery; the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 7 to 23); five‐year overall survival was 14.6%; median event‐free survival was 10 months (95% CI 7 to 13); and five‐year event‐free survival was 12.2%. In the other study, the ORR was 56% after myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation; 10‐year overall survival was 6.25%; and event‐free survival was not reported. With regard to short‐term adverse effects, one study showed a prevalence of 2% (95% CI 0% to 13%; best‐case scenario) for death due to myelosuppression. After the first cycle of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in one study, platelet toxicity occurred in 38% (95% CI 18% to 61%), neutrophil toxicity in 50% (95% CI 28% to 72%) and haemoglobin toxicity in 69% (95% CI 44% to 86%); after the second cycle this was 60% (95% CI 36% to 80%) for platelets and neutrophils and 53% (95% CI 30% to 75%) for haemoglobin. In one study, the prevalence of hepatic toxicity during or within four weeks after last the MIBG treatment was 0% (95% CI 0% to 9%; best‐case scenario). Neither study reported cardiovascular toxicity and sialoadenitis. One study assessed long‐term adverse events in some of the children: there was elevated plasma thyroid‐stimulating hormone in 45% (95% CI 27% to 65%) of children; in all children, free T4 was within the age‐related normal range (0%, 95% CI 0% to 15%). There were no secondary malignancies observed (0%, 95% CI 0% to 9%), but only five children survived more than four years. Authors' conclusions We identified no RCTs or CCTs comparing the effectiveness of treatment including  131 I‐MIBG therapy versus treatment not including  131 I‐MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL. We found two small observational studies including chilren. They had high risk of bias, and not all relevant outcome results were available. Based on the currently available evidence, we cannot make recommendations for the use of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL in clinical practice. More high‐quality research is needed. Plain language summary Iodine‐131‐meta‐iodobenzylguanidine therapy for patients with newly diagnosed high‐risk neuroblastoma Review question We reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness and side effects of  131 I‐meta‐iodobenzylguanidine ( 131 I‐MIBG) therapy in patients with newly diagnosed high‐risk (HR) neuroblastoma (NBL). Background NBL is a rare solid cancer that develops from special nerves cells. Patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL have a poor outcome, despite intensive treatments such as high‐dose chemotherapy to kill the cancer and surgery. This poor outcome needs research to look for new therapies, such as treatment with  131 I‐MIBG, which is a type of targeted radiotherapy (radiation directed at the cancer without causing too much damage to surrounding area). Study characteristics The evidence is current to April 2016. We found two cohort studies (where a group of people (the cohort) is followed over time, to examine different treatments received and subsequent outcomes) looking at  131 I‐MIBG treatment in 60 children with newly diagnosed HR NBL. Key results The studies were not comparable with regard to the children, the ways they were treated and the ways the different outcomes were defined and so it was impossible to combine the results in an analysis. Not all relevant outcome results were available. The percentages of children whose cancer reduced or disappeared after treatment (response rate) were 56% and 73% in the two studies, but survival was still poor: overall survival (length of time that the child remained alive) was about 15 months, event‐free survival (time during which there were no objective signs of tumor recurrence) was about 10 months. Overall survival five years after treatment was 14.6%, and after 10 years was 12.2%. With regard to short‐term side effects, there were some low blood cell counts. There was no liver toxicity. The studies did not report on heart problems and infections of the salivary glands. One study assessed long‐term side effects in some of the children: there was some evidence of thyroid (a gland in the neck) problems, which was brief in three children, but remained high in seven children, of whom five were prescribed medicine. There were no secondary cancers (where a different type of cancer has returned following the original cancer). Based on the currently available evidence, we cannot make recommendations for the use of  131 I‐MIBG therapy in patients with newly diagnosed HR NBL in clinical practice. More high‐quality research is needed before definite conclusions can be made.

CD008797.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Chronic pelvic pain is a common and debilitating condition; its aetiology is multifactorial, involving social, psychological and biological factors. The management of chronic pelvic pain is challenging, as despite interventions involving surgery, many women remain in pain without a firm gynaecological diagnosis. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of non‐surgical interventions for women with chronic pelvic pain. Search methods We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register. We also searched (from inception to 5 February 2014) AMED, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We handsearched sources such as citation lists, trial registers and conference proceedings. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on non‐surgical management of chronic pelvic pain were eligible for inclusion. We included studies of women with a diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome or adhesions but excluded those with pain known to be caused by endometriosis, primary dysmenorrhoea (period pain), active chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or irritable bowel syndrome. We considered studies of any non‐surgical intervention, including lifestyle, physical, medical and psychological treatments. Data collection and analysis Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Meta‐analysis was performed using the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome measure was pain relief, and secondary outcome measures were psychological outcomes, quality of life, requirement for analgesia and adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was assessed by using GRADE methods. Main results Twenty‐one RCTs were identified that involved non‐surgical management of chronic pelvic pain: 13 trials were included in the review, and eight were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women—406 women in the intervention groups and 344 in the control groups. Included studies had high attrition rates, and investigators often did not blind adequately or did not clearly describe randomisation procedures. Medical treatment versus placebo Progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)) was more effective than placebo at the end of treatment in terms of the number of women achieving a greater than 50% reduction in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score immediately after treatment (Peto OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.70 to 5.31, two studies, n = 204, I 2  = 22%, moderate‐quality evidence). Evidence of benefit was maintained up to nine months after treatment (Peto OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.71, two studies, n = 204, I 2  = 0%, moderate‐quality evidence). Women treated with progestogen reported more adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness) than those given placebo (high‐quality evidence). The estimated effect of lofexidine on pain outcomes when compared with placebo was compatible with benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.61, one study, 39 women, low‐quality evidence). Women in the lofexidine group reported more adverse effects (including drowsiness and dry mouth) than women given placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). Head‐to‐head comparisons of medical treatments Head‐to‐head comparisons showed that women taking goserelin had greater improvement in pelvic pain score (MD 3, 95% CI 2.08 to 3.92, one study, n = 47, moderate‐quality evidence) at one year than those taking progestogen. Women taking gabapentin had a lower VAS pain score than those taking amytriptyline (MD ‐1.50, 95% CI ‐2.06 to ‐0.94, n = 40, low‐quality evidence). Study authors reported that no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of adverse effects among women taking gabapentin compared with women given amytriptyline. The study comparing goserelin versus progestogen did not report on adverse effects. Psychological treatment Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those treated with a standard 'wait and see' policy (Peto OR 6.77, 95% CI 2.83 to 16.19, n = 90, low‐quality evidence). Significantly more women who had writing therapy as a disclosure reported improvement in pain than those in the non‐disclosure group (Peto OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.41 to 14.13, n = 48, very low‐quality evidence). No difference between groups in pain outcomes was noted when other psychological therapies were compared with standard care or placebo (quality of evidence ranged from very low to low). Studies did not report on adverse effects. Complementary therapy Distension of painful pelvic structures was more effective for pain when compared with counselling (MD 35.8, 95% CI 23.08 to 48.52 on a zero to 100 scale, one study, n = 48, moderate‐quality evidence). No difference in pain levels was observed when magnetic therapy was compared with use of a control magnet (very low‐quality evidence). Studies did not report on adverse effects. The results of studies examining psychological and complementary therapies could not be combined to yield meaningful results. Authors' conclusions Evidence of moderate quality supports progestogen as an option for chronic pelvic pain, with efficacy reported during treatment. In practice, this option may be most acceptable among women unconcerned about progestogenic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness—the most common adverse effects). Although some evidence suggests possible benefit of goserelin when compared with progestogen, gabapentin as compared with amytriptyline, ultrasound versus 'wait and see' and writing therapy versus non‐disclosure, the quality of evidence is generally low, and evidence is drawn from single studies. Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, RCTs of other medical, lifestyle and psychological interventions are urgently required. Plain language summary Non‐surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain Review question Cochrane authors considered the evidence for effectiveness and safety of non‐surgical treatrments for managing chronic pelvic pain in women. Background Chronic pelvic pain in women is a common problem. Specific causes are often difficult to identify, even after investigation with ultrasound and inspection of the pelvis with key hole surgery. Treatment is frequently limited to relief of symptoms obtained with a concoction of medicines. Cochrane review authors examined the evidence about non‐surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain. Study characteristics Twenty‐one randomised controlled studies were identified, of which 13 were included. Eight studies were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women—406 women in the intervention groups and 344 women in the control groups. The interventions assessed included medical treatment and psychological, cognitive, behavioural, complementary and physical therapies. The evidence is current to February 2014. Key results The review concludes that evidence shows improvement of pain in women given a high dose of progestogen (50 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) immediately post‐treatment and for up to nine months after treatment. However, progestogen was associated with adverse effects such as weight gain and bloating. Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and who received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those whose treatment involved a 'wait and see' policy. Some evidence of benefit was seen with writing disclosure therapy and with distension of painful pelvic structures. No good evidence of benefit was noted with other interventions when compared with standard care or placebo. The quality of the evidence was low or moderate for most comparisons, and in most cases evidence was derived from single small studies. Moreover, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions on quality of life and physical and functional outcomes because of the large variation in outcome measures used by the included studies. Many interventions identified in this review involved only single studies with small sample sizes. Additional studies will be required in the future to replicate results obtained with the use of specific medical interventions.",Non‐surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain,Cheong and  YC; Smotra and  G; Williams and  ACDC,3,2,,
CD006909.PUB3,"Abstract - Background A giant retinal tear is a full‐thickness retinal break that extends circumferentially around the retina for 90 degrees or more in the presence of a posteriorly detached vitreous. It causes significant visual morbidity from retinal detachment and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The fellow eye of patients who have had a spontaneous giant retinal tear has an increased risk of developing a giant retinal tear, a retinal detachment or both. Interventions such as 360‐degree encircling scleral buckling, 360‐degree cryotherapy and 360‐degree laser photocoagulation have been advocated by some ophthalmologists as prophylaxis for the fellow eye against the development of a giant retinal tear and/or a retinal detachment, or to prevent its extension. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic 360‐degree interventions in the fellow eye of patients with unilateral giant retinal tear to prevent the occurrence of a giant retinal tear, a retinal detachment or both. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1950 to December 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2011), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 6 December 2011. In addition, we searched the proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) up to 2008 for information about other relevant studies. Selection criteria Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one prophylactic treatment for fellow eyes of patients with giant retinal tear against observation (no treatment) or another form of prophylactic treatment. In the absence of RCTs, we planned to discuss case‐control studies that met the inclusion criteria but we would not conduct a meta‐analysis using these studies. Data collection and analysis We did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review and therefore no assessment of methodological quality or meta‐analysis could be performed. Main results No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions No strong evidence in the literature was found to support or refute prophylactic 360‐degree treatments to prevent a giant retinal tear or a retinal detachment in the fellow eye of patients with unilateral giant retinal tears. Plain language summary Interventions for prevention of giant retinal tear in the fellow eye A giant retinal tear is a full‐thickness retinal break that extends for 90 degrees or more around the circumference of the retina, in the presence of posterior vitreous detachment (when the vitreous comes away from the retina). Giant retinal tears cause visual loss as a result of the associated retinal detachment. They can be difficult to treat due to the large area of retinal involvement and the high risk of re‐detachment following vitreoretinal surgery, often related to the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (a scarring process that can happen on the inner or outer surface of the retina and in the vitreous cavity after retinal detachment). As the fellow eye has an increased risk of developing giant retinal tear and retinal detachment, prophylactic 360‐degree treatments with laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy or encircling scleral buckling have been proposed to reduce this risk. This review did not find any strong evidence in the form of prospective randomised controlled trials or case‐control studies to support or refute these prophylactic treatments.",Interventions for prevention of giant retinal tear in the fellow eye,Ang and  GS; Townend and  J; Lois and  N,2,3,,
CD010712,"Abstract - Background Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated pathological spinal conditions. It frequently afflicts the elderly population. Objectives To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) databases were searched up to June 2012. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials published in English, in which at least one arm provided data on nonoperative treatments Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by two review authors using the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group ( Furlan 2009 ). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as relative risk, continuous outcomes as mean difference or standardized mean difference; uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals. If possible a meta‐analysis was performed, otherwise results were described qualitatively. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Main results From the 8635 citations screened, 56 full‐text articles were assessed and 21 trials (1851 participants) were included. There was very low‐quality evidence from six trials that calcitonin is no better than placebo or paracetamol, regardless of mode of administration or outcome assessed. From single small trials, there was low‐quality evidence for prostaglandins, and very low‐quality evidence for gabapentin or methylcobalamin that they improved walking distance. There was very low‐quality evidence from a single trial that epidural steroid injections improved pain, function, and quality of life, up to two weeks, compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy. There was low‐quality evidence from a single trial that exercise is of short‐term benefit for leg pain and function compared with no treatment. There was low and very low‐quality evidence from six trials that multimodal nonoperative treatment is less effective than indirect or direct surgical decompression with or without fusion. A meta‐analysis of two trials comparing direct decompression with or without fusion to multimodal nonoperative care found no significant difference in function at six months (mean difference (MD) ‐3.66, 95% CI ‐10.12 to 2.80) and one year (MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐15.03 to 2.66), but at 24 months a significant difference was found favouring decompression (MD ‐4.43, 95% CI ‐7.91 to ‐0.96). Authors' conclusions Moderate and high‐quality evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibits recommendations for guiding clinical practice. Given the expected exponential rise in the prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, large high‐quality trials are urgently needed. Plain language summary Non‐surgical treatment for spinal stenosis with leg pain Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of non‐surgical treatments for people with leg pain caused by pressure on the nerves in the spine. Background If the spinal canal becomes narrow and presses on nerves (spinal stenosis) it can cause pain in the legs or buttocks (neurogenic claudication). Spinal stenosis is treated with a variety of non‐surgical methods, including painkillers and other medications, injections into the spine, exercise, physiotherapy and similar treatments. We wanted to discover whether using non‐surgical methods was better or worse than other alternatives. Study characteristics We included 21 randomised controlled trials that compared non‐surgical treatments to placebo, no treatment, or to surgery. All the participants had leg pain and a confirmed diagnosis of lumbar stenosis. There were 1851 people, with an average age of 50 years, equally divided between men and women. The follow‐up time ranged from one week to six years. The evidence was current to June 2012. Key results Overall, the review suggests that surgery is more effective at relieving pain than non‐surgical treatments. Medicines taken by mouth.  One small trial each of prostaglandins (compared to another medicine), gabapentin (compared to placebo), and vitamin B1 (compared to a variety of treatments) suggested improvements in pain and walking distance. Some digestive problems were reported with both medicines in the prostaglandins trial; and some people in the gabapentin trial reported dizziness or sleepiness. Epidural injections.  Two small trials showed short‐term improvements in pain and quality of life (up to two weeks) and two showed no difference compared with placebo injections. No trial reported bad reactions or problems. Calcitonin injections.  Six small trials indicated that calcitonin is no better than paracetemol or placebo. A number of people reported feeling sick or developed a rash. Mixed approaches compared to surgery.  Five trials compared results from surgery with results from a variety of non‐surgical treatments. One trial found that after two years there was no difference between treatments as far as pain was concerned. The other four found that surgery improved pain more than non‐surgical treatments over different time periods, but not necessarily walking ability. Between 5% and 18% suffered unwanted side effects from surgery, some serious. Physical therapy.  Four small trials, all including some form of exercise, failed to demonstrate improved walking ability after physical therapy. One trial each suggested that exercise is better than no treatment for leg pain, and that treadmill walking and stationary cycling produce similar, limited results. Quality of evidence The findings of all the trials in this study were based on low or very low‐quality evidence. The studies were poorly designed, or they failed to give enough information about what was done. This means that we cannot be confident that the findings are reliable, and further research may well come to a different conclusion.",Nonoperative treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication,Ammendolia and  C; Stuber and  KJ; Rok and  E; Rampersaud and  R; Kennedy and  CA; Pennick and  V; Steenstra and  IA; de Bruin and  LK; Furlan and  AD,3,2,,
CD004144.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Tubal sterilisation is the most popular contraceptive method in the world. Approximately 138 million women of reproductive age have had tubal sterilisation and there is evidence that increasingly younger women are being sterilized. With such large numbers of women choosing this option of birth control, it is clear that even if a small percentage of women later regret the decision, large numbers of women will seek counselling regarding reversal from their physicians. Objectives To compare the efficacy of surgical tubal reanastomosis and in vitro fertilisation in terms of live birth rates. The morbidity and cost‐effectiveness of both techniques were also to be compared. Search methods In a recent update of this review the following databases were searched: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009), PsychInfo (1806‐2009) and CENTRAL (2nd quarter 2009). We handsearched the reference lists of trials, reviews and relevant textbooks; searched abstracts from relevant conferences, and personally communicated with experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing surgical reversal of tubal sterilisation with in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Data collection and analysis No RCTs were found that met the selection criteria. Main results No data exist on which to report. Authors' conclusions There is little likelihood that any future research will be conducted to compare IVF with tubal reanastomosis for subfertility after tubal sterilisation. Therefore this review will not be updated in the future.

CD012551.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder in which the two main clinical features are pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health ‐ Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH‐CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. Objectives To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Search methods We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non‐pharmacological interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. Main results We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons. 1. Acupuncture:  (three studies, 204 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH‐CPSI score ‐5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐7.32 to ‐4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD ‐6.05, 95% CI ‐7.87 to ‐4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 2. Lifestyle modifications:  (one study, 100 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH‐CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 3. Physical activity:  (one study, 85 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐4.69 to ‐0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life. 4. Prostatic massage:  (two studies, 115 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy:  (three studies, 157 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐7.46 to ‐4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium‐term follow‐up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy:  (two studies, 237 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐3.82 to ‐1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 7. Other interventions:  there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. Authors' conclusions Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non‐pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient‐important outcomes including potential treatment‐related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes. Plain language summary Intervention for treating chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain in men Review question What are the effects of non‐medicine therapies in men with longstanding pain and discomfort around their prostate and pelvis, so‐called chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS)? Background CP/CPPS is a common disorder in which men feel pelvic pain or have bothersome symptoms (or both of these) when urinating. Its cause is unknown and there are many different treatments for this condition. Study characteristics The evidence was current to August 2017. We found 38 studies that were conducted between 1993 and 2016 with 3187 participants that made 23 comparisons between different treatments in men with CP/CPPS. The evaluated interventions usually implied the use of devices, medical advice or some form of physical therapy. In many cases, these therapies were given to men in an outpatient setting. Most studies did not specify their funding sources; three studies reported funding from device makers. Key results Acupuncture:  we found that acupuncture (an alternative medicine where thin needles are inserted into the skin at specific points) probably causes a significant decrease in symptoms of prostatitis and may not associated with side effects when compared with pretend acupuncture, however, it may not reduce sexual problems. It probably decreases symptoms when compared with standard medical therapy. We found no information on its effect on quality of life, depression or anxiety. Lifestyle modifications:  we are uncertain whether the recommendation of lifestyle modifications reduces symptoms when compared to the continuation of the same lifestyle. We had no information regarding side effects, sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. Physical activity:  we found that a physical activity programme may reduce symptoms (small effect) when compared with a non‐specific activity used as a control, however it may not reduce anxiety or depression. We have no information regarding side effects, sexual problems or quality of life. Prostatic massage:  we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases symptoms when compared with no massage. We found no information regarding side effects, sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy:  we found that extracorporeal shockwave therapy (where shock waves are passed through the skin to the prostate) causes a significant decrease in symptoms compared to a simulated procedure. These results may not be lasting after more continued treatment. This treatment may not be associated with side effects. We have no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy:  we found that transrectal thermotherapy (which applies heat to the prostate and pelvic muscle area) alone or in combination with medical therapy may cause a small decrease in symptoms compared to medical therapy alone. One of the included studies reported that participants may experience transient side effects. We have no information regarding sexual problems, quality of life, depression or anxiety. There is uncertainty about the effects of other interventions. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low in most cases, meaning that there is much uncertainty surrounding the results. The included studies were not well designed, had a small sample size and had a short follow‐up time (usually 12 weeks).",Non‐pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome,Franco and  JVA; Turk and  T; Jung and  JH; Xiao and  YT; Iakhno and  S; Garrote and  V; Vietto and  V,3,2,,
CD012014.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common problem in patients with intra‐abdominal cancer. Oral water soluble contrast (OWSC) has been shown to be useful in the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction in identifying patients who will recover with conservative management alone and also in reducing the length of hospital stay. It is not clear whether the benefits of OWSC in adhesive small bowel obstruction are also seen in patients with MBO. Objectives To determine the reliability of OWSC media and follow‐up abdominal radiographs in predicting the success of conservative treatment in resolving inoperable MBO with conservative management. To determine the efficacy and safety of OWSC media in reducing the duration of obstruction and reducing hospital stay in people with MBO. Search methods We identified studies from searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in Process, Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (Web of Science). We also searched registries of clinical trials and the CareSearch Grey Literature database. The date of the search was the 6 June 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or prospective controlled studies, that evaluated the diagnostic potential of OWSC in predicting which malignant bowel obstructions will resolve with conservative treatment. RCTs, or prospective controlled studies, that assessed the therapeutic potential of OWSC in managing MBO at any level compared with placebo, no intervention or usual treatment or supportive care. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias and assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results We found only one RCT meeting the selection criteria for the second objective (therapeutic potential) of this review. This study recruited nine participants. It compared the use of gastrografin versus placebo in adult patients with MBO with no indication for further intervention (surgery, endoscopy) apart from standardised conservative management. The overall risk of bias for the study was high due to issues with low numbers of participants, selective reporting of outcomes and a high attrition rate for the intervention arm. Primary outcomes The included trial was a pilot study whose primary outcome was to test the feasibility for a large study. The authors reported specifically on the number of patients screened, the number recruited and reasons for exclusion; this was not the focus of our review. Due to the low number of participants, the authors of the study decided not to report on our primary outcome of assessing the ability of OWSC to predict the likelihood of malignant small bowel obstruction resolving with conservative treatment alone (diagnostic effect). It also did not report on our primary outcome of rate of resolution of MBO in patients receiving OWSC compared with those not receiving it (therapeutic effect). The study reported that no issues regarding safety or tolerability of either gastrografin or placebo were identified. The overall quality of the evidence for the incidence of adverse events with OWSC was very low, downgraded twice for serious limitations to study quality (high risk of selective reporting and attrition bias) and downgraded once for imprecision (sparse data). Secondary outcomes The study planned to report on this review’s secondary outcome measures of length of hospital stay and time from administration of OWSC to resolution of MBO. However the authors of the study decided not to do so due to the low numbers of patients recruited. The study did not report on our secondary outcome measure of survival times from onset of inoperable MBO until death. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to determine the place of OWSC in predicting which patients with inoperable MBO will respond with conservative treatment alone. There is also insufficient evidence from RCTs to determine the therapeutic effects and safety of OWSC in patients with malignant small bowel obstruction. Plain language summary Oral water soluble contrast for cancer‐related bowel obstruction Background Intra‐abdominal cancer is where the cancer has either started elsewhere in the body and spread into the stomach area or started in the bowel itself. It can commonly grow and block the movement of food or faeces through the bowel. A blockage of the bowel caused by cancer is known as malignant bowel obstruction (MBO). Some patients with MBO benefit from surgery to reverse the blockage. In others it is not possible to reverse the MBO and it either resolves or becomes permanent (limiting prognosis to days or weeks). Scar tissue around the bowel (called adhesions) can also cause a blockage, this is known as adhesive small bowel obstruction. Adhesive obstructions often resolve with conservative management in hospital (allowing the bowel to 'rest' and recover). However in some, the obstruction requires surgery to remove the scar tissue and fix the blockage. Oral water soluble contrast (OWSC) is often prepared in liquid form and when swallowed before an x‐ray or computed tomography (CT) scan will show up clearly in the bowel. It can predict which people with adhesive small bowel obstruction will require surgery. In some patients it may also speed recovery leading to reduced hospital stay. It is not clear whether the benefits of OWSC in adhesive small bowel obstruction are also seen in MBO. Study characteristics We searched for evidence that OWSC could be used to identify which patients with inoperable MBO would recover with conservative management. We also wanted to know if OWSC increased the likelihood of recovery from MBO, reduced hospital stay or improved prognosis. Finally, we wished to know what side effects OWSC might cause for patients with MBO. We conducted the search in June 2017 and found one study. It only recruited nine participants and did not fully report on the outcomes of using OWSC in MBO. Key Findings We found insufficient evidence that OWSC can identify which patients with MBO will recover with conservative management. We found insufficient evidence that patients with MBO benefit from OWSC in terms of length of hospital stay, recovery time or survival. No conclusions could be made about side effects from OWSC. Quality of Evidence We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low due to the lack of studies reporting on the benefits of using OWSC in MBO and the only study we found reporting on side effects recruited very few participants (nine). The low quality of the evidence means that we are very uncertain about the use of OWSC in the management of MBO and cannot confirm its benefits or harms in patients with this condition.",Oral water soluble contrast for malignant bowel obstruction,Syrmis and  W; Richard and  R; Jenkins-Marsh and  S; Chia and  SC; Good and  P,2,3,,
CD009346.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Rocuronium bromide is a routinely used muscle relaxant in anaesthetic practice. Its use, however, is associated with intense pain on injection. While it is well established that rocuronium bromide injection causes pain in awake patients, anaesthetized patients also tend to show withdrawal movements of the limbs when this muscle relaxant is administered. Various strategies, both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological, have been studied to reduce the incidence and severity of pain on rocuronium bromide injection. We wanted to find out which of the existing modalities was best to reduce pain on rocuronium injection. Objectives The objectives of this review were to assess the ability of both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions to reduce or eliminate the pain that accompanies rocuronium bromide administration. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1966 to July 2013) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1980 to July 2013). We also searched specific websites. We reran the searches in February 2015 and will deal with the 11 studies of interest found through this search when we update the review. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any drug or a non‐pharmacological method with control patients, or those receiving no treatment to reduce the severity of pain with rocuronium injection. Our primary outcome was pain on rocuronium bromide injection measured by a pain score assessment. Our secondary outcomes were rise in heart rate and blood pressure following administration of rocuronium and adverse events related to the interventions. Data collection and analysis We used the standardized methods for conducting a systematic review as described in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Two authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We made all analyses on an intention‐to‐treat basis. We used a fixed‐effect model where there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies and a random‐effects model if heterogeneity was likely. Main results We included 66 studies with 7840 participants in the review, though most analyses were based on data from fewer participants. In total there are 17 studies awaiting classification. No studies were at a low risk of bias. We noted substantial statistical and clinical heterogeneity between trials. Most of the studies reported the primary outcome pain as assessed by verbal response from participants in an awake state but some trials reported withdrawal of the injected limb as a proxy for pain after induction of anaesthesia in response to rocuronium administration. Few studies reported adverse events and no study reported heart rate and blood pressure changes after administration of rocuronium. Lidocaine was the most commonly studied intervention drug, used in 29 trials with 2256 participants. The risk ratio (RR) of pain on injection if given lidocaine compared to placebo was 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.31; I² = 65%, low quality of evidence). The RR of pain on injection if fentanyl and remifentanil were given compared to placebo was 0.42 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.70; I² = 79%, low quality of evidence) and (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.26; I² = 74%, low quality of evidence), respectively. Pain on injection of intervention drugs was reported with the use of lidocaine and acetaminophen in one study. Cough was reported with the use of fentanyl (one study), remifentanil (five studies, low quality evidence) and alfentanil (one study). Breath holding and chest tightness were reported with the use of remifentanil in two studies (very low quality evidence) and one study (very low quality evidence), respectively. The overall rate of complications was low. Authors' conclusions The evidence to suggest that the most commonly investigated pharmacological interventions reduce pain on injection of rocuronium is of low quality due to risk of bias and inconsistency. There is low or very low quality evidence for adverse events, due to risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision of effect. We did not compare the various interventions with one another and so cannot comment on the superiority of one intervention over another. Complications were reported more often with use of opioids. Plain language summary Use of drug and non‐drug interventions to reduce pain associated with rocuronium bromide injection in patients undergoing general anaesthesia Review question What is the effect of using drug or non‐drug treatments (such as diluting the rocuronium or warming the site of injection) for reducing the pain associated with injecting the muscle relaxant rocuronium bromide in children and adults? Background Rocuronium bromide is a muscle relaxant used as part of general anaesthesia for surgery. Muscle relaxants are used to relax the muscles of the airway to enable endotracheal intubation (placing a breathing tube in the windpipe to support the airway while the person is unconscious) and to facilitate the surgery. However, rocuronium bromide can cause intense pain as it is injected in some people. We wanted to find out whether giving another drug, such as a painkiller or another anaesthetic, or a non‐drug intervention, such as diluting the rocuronium, would be useful in reducing the pain experienced by some people on injection of rocuronium. Study characteristics We included trials up to July 2013 in our review. We re‐ran the searches in February 2015. In total there are 17 studies awaiting classification. We included 66 studies with 7840 participants, both male and female, and including children and adults. Most of these participants were undergoing various planned surgical procedures in hospitals in several countries including Korea, Turkey and India. The trials compared an intervention aiming to reduce pain on injection with a placebo to ascertain whether any intervention was effective at reducing pain. The outcome was assessed by recording the level of pain reported by patients when injected with rocuronium bromide. Key results The most studied treatments were injection of the local anaesthetic lidocaine, or the painkillers fentanyl or remifentanil, into the vein before injecting rocuronium. These treatments may reduce the pain associated with injecting rocuronium, but the evidence is of low quality. Some interventions, for example using painkillers such as fentanyl, may increase cough, chest tightness and breath holding. These are recognized side effects of these drugs. Quality of the evidence The low quality of the evidence for the assessment of changes in the level of pain was due to inadequate reporting of study design and variation in the study results. In addition to these limitations, for some adverse event outcomes we did not have enough information to be certain about the average effect. Further research is needed with high quality, well designed studies to determine whether pain on injection of rocuronium bromide can be reduced by using an appropriate intervention.",Pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for reducing rocuronium bromide induced pain on injection in children and adults,Prabhakar and  H; Singh and  GP; Ali and  Z; Kalaivani and  M; Smith and  MA,3,2,,
CD000324.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Treatment options for tubal ectopic pregnancy are; (1) surgery, e.g. salpingectomy or salpingo(s)tomy, either performed laparoscopically or by open surgery; (2) medical treatment, with a variety of drugs, that can be administered systemically and/or locally by various routes and (3) expectant management. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of surgery, medical treatment and expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy in view of primary treatment success, tubal preservation and future fertility. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (up to February 2006), Current Controlled Trials Register (up to October 2006), and MEDLINE (up to October 2006). Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatments in women with tubal ectopic pregnancy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality. Differences were resolved by discussion with all review authors. Main results Thirty five studies have been analyzed on the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy, describing 25 different comparisons.   Surgery   Laparoscopic salpingostomy is significantly less successful than the open surgical approach in the elimination of tubal ectopic pregnancy (2 RCTs, n = 165, OR 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.86) due to a significant higher persistent trophoblast rate in laparoscopic surgery (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 11). However, the laparoscopic approach is significantly less costly than open surgery (P = 0.03). Long term follow up (n = 127) shows no evidence of a difference in intra uterine pregnancy rate (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.5) but there is a non significant tendency to a lower repeat ectopic pregnancy rate (OR 0.47, 95% 0.15 to 1.5). Medical treatment   Systemic methotrexate in a fixed multiple dose intramuscular regimen has a non significant tendency to a higher treatment success than laparoscopic salpingostomy (1 RCT, n = 100, OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.73 to 4.6). No significant differences are found in long term follow up (n=74): intra uterine pregnancy (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.1) and repeat ectopic pregnancy (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.1). Expectant management   Expectant management is significantly less successful than prostaglandin therapy (1 RCT, n = 23, OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39). Authors' conclusions In the surgical treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy laparoscopic surgery is a cost effective treatment. An alternative non surgical treatment option in selected patients is medical treatment with systemic methotrexate. Expectant management can not be adequately evaluated yet. Plain language summary Interventions for tubal ectopic pregnancy Approximately 1% of fertilized eggs implant outside the uterine cavity and develop into extra uterine pregnancies known as ectopic pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancies can occur anywhere along the reproductive tract with the most common site being the fallopian tube.  An ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube, if not treated, can cause tubal rupture and/or intra abdominal bleeding. Treatment options for tubal ectopic pregnancy are surgery, medical treatment, and expectant management.  This review of 35 randomised controlled trials found that laparoscopic surgery is feasible and less expensive than open surgery in the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy. In selected patients, non‐surgical treatment options can be used. Medical treatment with systemic methotrexate is an option for women with tubal ectopic pregnancy with no signs of bleeding whose pregnancy hormone blood levels are relatively low. An evaluation of expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy cannot be adequately made yet.",Interventions for tubal ectopic pregnancy,Hajenius and  PJ; Mol and  F; Mol and  BWJ; Bossuyt and  PMM; Ankum and  WM; Van der Veen and  F,1,3,,
CD004980,"Abstract - Background Varicose veins are a relatively common condition and account for around 54,000 in‐patient hospital episodes per year. The two most common interventions for varicose veins are surgery and sclerotherapy. However, there is little comparative data regarding their effectiveness. Objectives To identify whether the use of surgery or sclerotherapy should be recommended for the management of primary varicose veins. Search methods Thirteen electronic bibliographic databases were searched covering biomedical, science, social science, health economic and grey literature (including current research). In addition, the reference lists of relevant articles were checked and various health services research‐related resources were consulted via the internet. These included health economics and HTA organisations, guideline producing agencies, generic research and trials registers, and specialist sites. Selection criteria All studies that were described as randomised controlled trials comparing surgery with sclerotherapy for the treatment of primary varicose veins were identified. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted and summarised data from the eligible studies using a data extraction sheet for consistency. All studies were cross‐checked independently by the authors. Main results A total of 2306 references were found from our searches, 61 of which were identified as potential trials comparing surgery and sclerotherapy. However, only nine randomised trials, described in a total of 14 separate papers, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Fifty trials were excluded and one trial is ongoing and is due for completion in 2004. The trials used a variety of outcome measures and classification systems which made direct comparison between trials difficult. However, the trend was for sclerotherapy to be evaluated as significantly better than surgery at one year; after one year (sclerotherapy resulted in worse outcomes) the benefits with sclerotherapy were less, and by three to five years surgery had better outcomes. The data on cost‐effectiveness was not adequately reported. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend the use of sclerotherapy or surgery. There needs to be more research that specifically examines both costs and outcomes for surgery and sclerotherapy. Plain language summary Surgery versus sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins Sclerotherapy (injection of a substance into the vein) shows greater benefits than surgery in the short term but surgery has greater benefits in the longer term. Varicose veins are a relatively common problem. Two treatments available are surgery and sclerotherapy. Both involve removal of the vein either by stripping it out (surgery) or by injecting it with a solution that causes it to collapse and be absorbed into the surrounding tissues (sclerotherapy). Neither treatment adversely affects blood flow through the limb. This review found that sclerotherapy was better than surgery in terms of treatment success, complication rate and cost at one year, but surgery was better after five years. However, the evidence was not of very good quality and more research is needed.",Surgery versus sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins,Rigby and  KA; Palfreyman and  SJ; Beverley and  C; Michaels and  JA,3,2,,
CD007884.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Endoscopy and surgery are the treatment modalities of choice for patients with chronic pancreatitis and dilated pancreatic duct (obstructive chronic pancreatitis). Physicians face, without clear consensus, the choice between endoscopy or surgery for this group of patients. Objectives To assess and compare the effects and complications of surgical and endoscopic interventions in the management of pain for obstructive chronic pancreatitis. Search methods We searched the following databases in  The Cochrane Library : CENTRAL (2014, Issue 2), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014, Issue 2), and DARE (2014, Issue 2). We also searched the following databases up to 25 March 2014: MEDLINE (from 1950), Embase (from 1980), and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (CPCI‐S) (from 1990). We performed a cross‐reference search. Two review authors independently performed the selection of trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of endoscopic or surgical interventions in obstructive chronic pancreatitis. We included trials comparing endoscopic versus surgical interventions as well as trials comparing either endoscopic or surgical interventions to conservative treatment (i.e. non‐invasive treatment modalities). We included relevant trials irrespective of blinding, the number of participants randomised, and the language of the article. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two authors independently extracted data from the articles. We evaluated the methodological quality of the included trials and requested additional information from study authors in the case of missing data. Main results We identified three eligible trials. Two trials compared endoscopic intervention with surgical intervention and included a total of 111 participants: 55 in the endoscopic group and 56 in the surgical group. Compared with the endoscopic group, the surgical group had a higher proportion of participants with pain relief, both at middle/long‐term follow‐up (two to five years: risk ratio (RR) 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 2.15) and long‐term follow‐up (≥ five years, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.05). Surgical intervention resulted in improved quality of life and improved preservation of exocrine pancreatic function at middle/long‐term follow‐up (two to five years), but not at long‐term follow‐up (≥ 5 years). No differences were found in terms of major post‐interventional complications or mortality, although the number of participants did not allow for this to be reliably evaluated. One trial, including 32 participants, compared surgical intervention with conservative treatment: 17 in the surgical group and 15 in the conservative group. The trial showed that surgical intervention resulted in a higher percentage of participants with pain relief and better preservation of pancreatic function. The trial had methodological limitations, and the number of participants was relatively small. Authors' conclusions For patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis and dilated pancreatic duct, this review shows that surgery is superior to endoscopy in terms of pain relief. Morbidity and mortality seem not to differ between the two intervention modalities, but the small trials identified do not provide sufficient power to detect the small differences expected in this outcome. Regarding the comparison of surgical intervention versus conservative treatment, this review has shown that surgical intervention in an early stage of chronic pancreatitis is a promising approach in terms of pain relief and pancreatic function. Other trials need to confirm these results because of the methodological limitations and limited number of participants assessed in the present evidence. Plain language summary Endoscopy or surgery for patients with chronic pancreatitis and dilated pancreatic duct Background Endoscopy and surgery are the treatments of choice in patients with chronic pancreatitis and a dilated pancreatic duct. Pain is the most important symptom in this disease and can be severely debilitating. In addition, chronic pancreatitis can result in malabsorption and/or diabetes due to failure of the gland function of the pancreas. Question In this review, we compare endoscopy versus surgery in terms of pain relief, complications and mortality in patients with chronic pancreatitis with a dilated pancreatic duct. Study characteristics We performed a search in March 2014 and found three relevant randomised trials. Two comparing endoscopic versus surgical interventions (111 patients with durations of two and three years), while the third compared surgery to conservative treatment (i.e. no intervention) (32 patients with a duration of 16 months). Key results We found that surgery achieved pain relief in a higher proportion of participants than endoscopy. Surgery also had other advantages like improved quality of life for the first two years after intervention, although this difference disappeared with time. Similarly, surgery reduced the risk of developing malabsorption due to failure of the pancreas, but with longer follow‐up this advantage became smaller. The studies seemingly showed no difference between endoscopy and surgery in complications after interventions. We also compared surgery with conservative treatment. The results of one trial suggested that surgery early in the condition achieved better pain relief and preservation of pancreatic function. Quality of evidence For endoscopy versus surgery, the quality of the evidence for pain relief, quality of life and pancreatic function was moderate (according to GRADE). For both complications and mortality this was low, since the two trials were too small to make reliable conclusions. The quality of evidence regarding surgery versus conservative treatment was low, since the trial was small, which precluded drawing reliable conclusions regarding all outcomes.",Endoscopic or surgical intervention for painful obstructive chronic pancreatitis,Ahmed Ali and  U; Pahlplatz and  JM; Nealon and  WH; van Goor and  H; Gooszen and  HG; Boermeester and  MA,2,3,,
CD008282,"Abstract - Background Adenoidectomy, surgical removal of the adenoids, is a common ENT operation worldwide in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms. A systematic review on the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in this specific group has not previously been performed. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of adenoidectomy versus non‐surgical management in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 March 2009. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing adenoidectomy, with or without tympanostomy tubes, versus non‐surgical management or tympanostomy tubes alone in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms. The primary outcome studied was the number of episodes, days per episode and per year with nasal symptoms and the proportion of children with recurrent episodes of nasal symptoms. Secondary outcomes were mean number of episodes, mean number of days per episode and per year, and proportion of children with nasal obstruction alone. Data collection and analysis Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. Main results Only one study included children scheduled for adenoidectomy because of recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms or middle ear disease. In this study no beneficial effect of adenoidectomy was found. The numbers in this study were, however, small (n = 76) and the quality of the study was moderate. The outcome was improvement in episodes of common colds. The risk differences were non‐significant, being 2% (95% CI ‐18% to 22%) and ‐11% (95% CI ‐28% to 7%) after 12 and 24 months, respectively. A second study included children with recurrent acute otitis media (n = 180). As otitis media is known to be associated with nasal symptoms, the number of days with rhinitis was studied as a secondary outcome measure. The risk difference was non‐significant, being ‐4 days (95% CI ‐13 to 7 days). Authors' conclusions Current evidence regarding the effect of adenoidectomy on recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms or nasal obstruction alone is sparse, inconclusive and has a significant risk of bias. High quality trials assessing the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms should be initiated. Plain language summary Adenoidectomy for recurrent of chronic nasal symptoms in children Infections of the upper respiratory tract, presenting as recurrent nasal symptoms (nasal discharge with or without nasal obstruction) are very common in children. Removal of the adenoids (adenoidectomy) is a surgical procedure that is frequently performed in these children. It is thought that adenoidectomy prevents recurrence of nasal symptoms. Our review, which includes two studies (256 children), shows that it is uncertain whether adenoidectomy is effective in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms. Further high quality trials are needed.",Adenoidectomy for recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms in children,van den Aardweg and  MTA; Schilder and  AGM; Herkert and  E; Boonacker and  CWB; Rovers and  MM,3,1,,
CD011478.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with 528,000 estimated new cases globally in 2012. A large majority (around 85%) of the disease burden occurs in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), where it accounts for almost 12% of all female cancers. Treatment of stage IB2 cervical cancers, which sit between early and advanced disease, is controversial. Some centres prefer to treat these cancers by radical hysterectomy, with chemoradiotherapy reserved for those at high risk of recurrence. In the UK, we treat stage IB2 cervical cancers mainly with chemoradiotherapy, based on the rationale that a high percentage will have risk factors necessitating chemoradiotherapy postsurgery. There has been no systematic review to determine the best possible evidence in managing these cancers. Objectives To determine if primary surgery for stage IB2 cervical cancer (type II or type III radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy) improves survival compared to primary chemoradiotherapy. To determine if primary surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, for stage IB2 cervical cancer increases patient morbidity in the management of stage IB2 cervical cancer compared to primary chemoradiotherapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to April week 2, 2018) and Embase via Ovid (1980 to 2018 week 16). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies up to April 2018. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs or non‐randomised studies (NRSs) comparing surgery to chemoradiotherapy in stage IB2 cervical cancers. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, abstracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We identified 4968 records from the literature searches, but we did not identify any RCTs that compared primary surgery with chemoradiotherapy in stage IB2 cervical cancer. We found one NRS comparing surgery to chemoradiotherapy in IB2 and IIA2 cervical cancers which met the inclusion criteria. However, we were unable to obtain data for stage IB2 cancers only and considered the findings very uncertain due to a high risk of selection bias. Authors' conclusions There is an absence of high‐certainty evidence on the relative benefits and harms of primary radical hysterectomy versus primary chemoradiotherapy for stage IB2 cervical cancer. More research is needed on the different treatment options in stage IB2 cervical cancer, particularly with respect to survival, adverse effects, and quality of life to facilitate informed decision‐making and individualised care. Plain language summary Surgery or chemoradiotherapy for stage IB2 cervical cancer The issue  Treatment of cervical cancers that are larger than 4 cm still thought to be confined to the cervix (classified as stage IB2 cervical cancer) is controversial. Some clinicians believe that a combination of radiotherapy (high‐energy rays) and chemotherapy (anti‐cancer drugs), together known as chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation, is better when the tumours are larger than 4 cm. This is based on the argument that the chance of the cancer returning after surgery is high, therefore most women will need chemoradiotherapy, even if they have surgery initially. The other school of thought is that these tumours are so large that they do not respond well to chemoradiotherapy and women with this stage of cervical cancer would benefit from surgery despite being at high risk of needing chemoradiotherapy after surgery. However, there are concerns about toxicity and complications related to the use of both surgery and chemoradiotherapy in women with cervical cancer, as receiving both treatments can increase morbidity. Therefore, many centres have moved towards providing only chemoradiotherapy. As there remains uncertainty about which treatment (surgery or chemoradiotherapy) is better for women with stage IB2 cervical cancer, we conducted this systematic review to try and answer this question.  How we conducted the review  We searched for evidence that compared chemoradiotherapy to surgery (type II or type III radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy) from 1946 to April 2018. We searched for both randomised controlled trials (where people taking part are put into groups at random) and non‐randomised studies (in which a defined group of people (the cohort) are followed over time).  What we found  We only found one non‐randomised study that compared surgery with chemoradiotherapy, but this study combined data on stages IB2 to IIA. Although it met the inclusion criteria, we could not analyse the data as we could not extract data specific to stage IB2 cervical cancers, therefore we considered the findings of this study to be uncertain with respect to our review question.  Conclusions  At present, there is no high‐certainty evidence to inform us of which of the current treatment options (chemoradiotherapy or radical surgery) is better for stage IB2 cervical cancer. Women with stage IB2 cervical cancer should be counselled regarding this uncertainty and potential side effects, and the choice of treatment should take into account the availability of the treatments in a particular health resource and patient preference. Ideally, a large multicentred trial is needed to determine which of the two treatments are better for treating women with stage IB2 cervical cancer. However, because of the relative rarity of stage 1B2 cancer, and the potential complications resulting from combining surgery and chemoradiotherapy, clinicians might continue to treat most women with chemoradiotherapy, and trials in this field might not be feasible.",Type II or type III radical hysterectomy compared to chemoradiotherapy as a primary intervention for stage IB2 cervical cancer,Nama and  V; Angelopoulos and  G; Twigg and  J; Murdoch and  JB; Bailey and  J; Lawrie and  TA,3,2,,
CD003263.PUB5,"Abstract - Background Vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder characterised by patchy loss of skin colour. Some people experience itching before the appearance of a new patch. It affects people of any age or ethnicity, more than half of whom develop it before the age of 20 years. There are two main types: generalised vitiligo, the common symmetrical form, and segmental, affecting only one side of the body. Around 1% of the world's population has vitiligo, a disease causing white patches on the skin. Several treatments are available. Some can restore pigment but none can cure the disease. Objectives To assess the effects of all therapeutic interventions used in the management of vitiligo. Search methods We updated our searches of the following databases to October 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library  (2013, Issue 10), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We also searched five trials databases, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of treatments for vitiligo. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and extracted data. Main results This update of the 2010 review includes 96 studies, 57 from the previous update and 39 new studies, totalling 4512 participants. Most of the studies, covering a wide range of interventions, had fewer than 50 participants. All of the studies assessed repigmentation, however only five reported on all of our three primary outcomes which were quality of life, > 75% repigmentation and adverse effects. Of our secondary outcomes, six studies measured cessation of spread but none assessed long‐term permanence of repigmentation resulting from treatment at two years follow‐up. Most of the studies assessed combination therapies which generally reported better results. New interventions include seven new surgical interventions. We analysed the data from 25 studies which assessed our primary outcomes. We used the effect measures risk ratio (RR), and odds ratio (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and where N is the number of participants in the study. We were only able to analyse one of nine studies assessing quality of life and this showed no statistically significant improvement between the comparators. Nine analyses from eight studies reported >75% repigmentation. In the following studies the repigmentation was better in the combination therapy group: calcipotriol plus PUVA (psoralen with UVA light) versus PUVA (paired OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.43 to 12.64, one study, N = 27); hydrocortisone‐17‐butyrate plus excimer laser versus excimer laser alone (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.50, one study, N = 84); oral minipulse of prednisolone (OMP) plus NB‐UVB (narrowband UVB) versus OMP alone (RR 7.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 53.26, one study, N = 47); azathioprine with PUVA versus PUVA alone (RR 17.77, 95% CI 1.08 to 291.82, one study, N = 58) and 8‐Methoxypsoralen (8‐MOP ) plus sunlight versus psoralen (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.91, one study, N = 168). In these three studies  ginkgo biloba  was better than placebo (RR 4.40, 95% CI 1.08 to 17.95, one study, N = 47); clobetasol propionate was better than PUVAsol (PUVA with sunlight) (RR 4.70, 95% CI 1.14 to 19.39, one study, N = 45); split skin grafts with PUVAsol was better than minipunch grafts with PUVAsol (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.85, one study, N = 64). We performed one meta‐analysis of three studies, in which we found a non‐significant 60% increase in the proportion of participants achieving >75% repigmentation in favour of NB‐UVB compared to PUVA (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.45; I² = 0%). Studies assessing topical preparations, in particular topical corticosteroids, reported most adverse effects. However, in combination studies it was difficult to ascertain which treatment caused these effects. We performed two analyses from a pooled analysis of three studies on adverse effects. Where NB‐UVB was compared to PUVA, the NB‐UVB group reported less observations of nausea in three studies (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.69; I² = 0% three studies, N = 156) and erythema in two studies (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; I² = 0%, two studies, N = 106), but not itching in two studies (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.60; I² = 0%, two studies, N = 106). Very few studies only assessed children or included segmental vitiligo. We found one study of psychological interventions but we could not include the outcomes in our statistical analyses. We found no studies evaluating micropigmentation, depigmentation, or cosmetic camouflage. Authors' conclusions This review has found some evidence from individual studies to support existing therapies for vitiligo, but the usefulness of the findings is limited by the different designs and outcome measurements and lack of quality of life measures. There is a need for follow‐up studies to assess permanence of repigmentation as well as high‐quality randomised trials using standardised measures and which also address quality of life. Plain language summary Treatments for vitiligo Background Vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder characterised by patchy loss of skin colour. Some people experience itching before the appearance of a new patch. It affects people of any age or ethnicity, more than half of whom develop it before the age of 20 years. There are two main types: generalised vitiligo, the common symmetrical form, and segmental, affecting only one side of the body. Recent genetic research suggests that generalised vitiligo is, at least in part, an autoimmune condition which destroys melanocytes (pigment cells). Although our understanding of vitiligo has increased, its causes are still poorly understood. Several treatments are available. Some can restore pigment but none can cure it or prevent its spread or recurrence. Vitiligo patches can have a major psychosocial impact, especially for people with dark or tanned skin or when the face or hands are affected. People with vitiligo can be stigmatised, often experiencing low self‐esteem and a lack of self‐confidence. Children with vitiligo may be teased and bullied at school. Despite this, we found only one study assessing psychological therapy for vitiligo. Review question What treatments work best to help manage vitiligo? Study characteristics In this update search we found 39 new randomised controlled trials which, added to the 57 studies included previously, makes a total of 96 studies with 4512 participants. Key results Twenty‐one (21/39, 54%) of the new studies assessed new treatments, most of which involved the use of light. Narrowband UVB (NB‐UVB) light was used in 35/96 (36% of all included studies), either alone or in combination with other therapies and achieved the best results. There were 18 surgical studies and 31 studies compared active treatment versus placebo. Half of the studies lasted longer than six months. Most of them 69/96 (72%) had fewer than 50 participants. Only seven studies assessed children and one study only recruited men. The majority of studies (53/96, 55%), most of which were of combination treatments with light, assessed more than 75% repigmentation. Eight studies reported a statistically significant result for this outcome, including the following four results: topical corticosteroids were better than PUVAsol (psoralen with sunlight), hydrocortisone plus laser light was better than laser light alone,  ginkgo biloba  was better than placebo and oral minipulse of prednisolone (OMP) plus NB‐UVB was better than OMP alone. None of the studies reported the long‐term benefit of the treatment i.e. two years' sustained repigmentation. The maximum follow‐up time, reported in only one study, was one year post‐treatment. Only 9/96 (9%) reported the quality of life of participants, but the majority of all studies (65/96, 68%) reported adverse effects, mainly for topical treatments, some of which caused itching, redness, skin thinning, telangiectasia and atrophy. Neither mometasone furoate nor hydrocortisone produced adverse effects. Some NB‐UVB studies reported phototoxic reaction and Koebnerisation whereas some PUVA (psoralen with artificial light UVA as a light source) studies caused dizziness and nausea. Six studies reported cessation of spread of vitiligo, one of which showed that  ginkgo biloba  was more than twice as likely to stop vitiligo spreading than placebo. This review has highlighted the recent surge in vitiligo research providing insights into its causes. The majority of the studies reporting successful repigmentation were combinations of various interventions with light, indicating this is an effective, though not necessarily permanent, treatment for generalised vitiligo. In view of the fact that vitiligo has no cure, providing ways of coping with it could be of benefit to patients and should be part of standard care. Better designed studies, consensus on how to measure treatment success, more studies involving children and studies assessing psychological interventions, are needed. Quality of the evidence Since the last update (2010), the design and reporting of vitiligo trials have not greatly improved. Only five studies met the criteria for a well‐designed trial. Poor design, the number and complexity of the treatments and the fact that many of the studies assessed individual vitiligo patches in the same participant, made comparison of the studies difficult. Consequently, we could only perform one meta‐analysis of three studies comparing NB‐UVB with PUVA which showed that NB‐UVB has fewer side effects and is marginally better than PUVA.",Interventions for vitiligo,Whitton and  ME; Pinart and  M; Batchelor and  J; Leonardi‐Bee and  J; González and  U; Jiyad and  Z; Eleftheriadou and  V; Ezzedine and  K,3,1,,
CD002116.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Faecal incontinence (leakage of bowel motions or stool) is a common symptom which causes significant distress and reduces quality of life. Objectives To assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of faecal incontinence. In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of Trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 June 2012) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. Main results Sixteen trials were identified, including 558 participants. Eleven trials were of cross‐over design. Eleven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea, following ileoanal pouch or rectal surgery, or due to use of a weight‐reducing drug). Two trials were amongst people with weak anal sphincters, one in participants with faecal impaction and bypass leakage, and one in geriatric patients. In one trial there was no specific cause for faecal incontinence. Seven trials tested anti‐diarrhoeal drugs to reduce faecal incontinence and other bowel symptoms (loperamide, diphenoxylate plus atropine, and codeine). Six trials tested drugs that enhance anal sphincter function (phenylepinephrine gel and sodium valproate). Two trials evaluated osmotic laxatives (lactulose) for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with constipation in geriatric patients. One trial assessed the use of zinc‐aluminium ointment for faecal incontinence. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified. There was limited evidence that antidiarrhoeal drugs and drugs that enhance anal sphincter tone may reduce faecal incontinence in patients with liquid stools. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects (such as constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and nausea) than placebo. However, the dose may be titrated to the patient's symptoms to minimise side effects while achieving continence. The drugs acting on the sphincter sometimes resulted in local dermatitis, abdominal pain or nausea. Laxative use in geriatric patients reduced faecal soiling and the need for help from nurses. Zinc‐aluminium ointment was associated with improved quality of life, with no reported adverse effects. However, the observed improvement in quality of life was seen in the placebo group as well as the treatment group. It should be noted that all the included trials in this review had small sample sizes and short duration of follow‐up. 'Risk of bias' assessment was unclear for most of the domains as there was insufficient information. There were no data suitable for meta‐analysis. Authors' conclusions The small number of trials identified for this review assessed several different drugs in a variety of patient populations. The focus of most of the included trials was on the treatment of diarrhoea, rather than faecal incontinence. There is little evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of drug therapies for faecal incontinence. Larger, well‐designed controlled trials, which use the recommendations and principles set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required. Plain language summary Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults Faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements or leakage of stool or faeces) is a common healthcare problem, affecting up to one in 10 of adults living at home. This affects daily activities in about one or two in 100 people. It is more common in people living in residential care. Leakage of urine often occurs as well. Faecal incontinence can be debilitating and embarrassing. Treatments include pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, surgery and drugs. This review looked at drugs for the treatment of faecal incontinence. These included anti‐diarrhoea drugs or laxatives to regulate stools, and drugs to try to enhance the tone of muscle around the anus which help to keep it closed. Sixteen small trials were found, including 558 participants. The review of these trials found some evidence that anti‐diarrhoea drugs may reduce faecal incontinence for people having liquid stools. However, these drugs were associated with some side effects. There was some evidence that drugs to enhance the tone of the muscle around the anus may help, but more research is needed.",Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults,Omar and  MI; Alexander and  CE,3,2,,
CD011680.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe and rapidly spreading soft tissue infections of the subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle, which are mostly caused by bacteria. Associated rates of mortality and morbidity are high, with the former estimated at around 23%, and disability, sequelae, and limb loss occurring in 15% of patients. Standard management includes intravenous empiric antimicrobial therapy, early surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, intensive care support, and adjuvant therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Objectives To assess the effects of medical and surgical treatments for necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) in adults in hospital settings. Search methods We searched the following databases up to April 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, pharmaceutical company trial results databases, and the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency websites. We checked the reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria RCTs conducted in hospital settings, that evaluated any medical or surgical treatment for adults with NSTI were eligible for inclusion. Eligible medical treatments included 1) comparisons between different antimicrobials or with placebo; 2) adjuvant therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) therapy compared with placebo; no treatment; or other adjuvant therapies. Eligible surgical treatments included surgical debridement compared with amputation, immediate versus delayed intervention, or comparisons of number of interventions. RCTs of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy for NSTI were ineligible because HBO is the focus of another Cochrane Review. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were 1) mortality within 30 days, and 2) proportion of participants who experience a serious adverse event. Secondary outcomes were 1) survival time, and 2) assessment of long‐term morbidity. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results We included three trials randomising 197 participants (62% men) who had a mean age of 55 years. One trial compared two antibiotic treatments, and two trials compared adjuvant therapies with placebo. In all trials, participants concomitantly received standard interventions, such as intravenous empiric antimicrobial therapy, surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, intensive care support, and adjuvant therapies. All trials were at risk of attrition bias and one trial was not blinded. Moxifloxacin versus amoxicillin‐clavulanate One trial included 54 participants who had a NSTI; it compared a third‐generation quinolone, moxifloxacin, at a dose of 400 mg given once daily, against a penicillin, amoxicillin‐clavulanate, at a dose of 3 g given three times daily for at least three days, followed by 1.5 g three times daily. Duration of treatment varied from 7 to 21 days. We are uncertain of the effects of these treatments on mortality within 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 23.07) and serious adverse events at 28 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.31) because the quality of the evidence is very low. AB103 versus placebo One trial of 43 randomised participants compared two doses, 0.5 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg, of an adjuvant drug, a CD28 antagonist receptor (AB103), with placebo. Treatment was given via infusion pump for 10 minutes before, after, or during surgery within six hours after the diagnosis of NSTI. We are uncertain of the effects of AB103 on mortality rate within 30 days (RR of 0.34, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.16) and serious adverse events measured at 28 days (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.52 to 4.27) because the quality of the evidence is very low. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) versus placebo One trial of 100 randomised participants assessed IVIG as an adjuvant drug, given at a dose of 25 g/day, compared with placebo, given for three consecutive days. There may be no clear difference between IVIG and placebo in terms of mortality within 30 days (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.23) (low‐certainty evidence), nor serious adverse events experienced in the intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 0.73 CI 95% 0.32 to 1.65) (low‐certainty evidence). Serious adverse events were only described in one RCT (the IVIG versus placebo trial) and included acute kidney injury, allergic reactions, aseptic meningitis syndrome, haemolytic anaemia, thrombi, and transmissible agents. Only one trial reported assessment of long‐term morbidity, but the outcome was not defined in the way we prespecified in our protocol. The trial used the Short Form Health Survey (SF36). Data on survival time were provided upon request for the trials comparing amoxicillin‐clavulanate versus moxifloxacin and IVIG versus placebo. However, even with data provided, it was not possible to perform survival analysis. Authors' conclusions We found very little evidence on the effects of medical and surgical treatments for NSTI. We cannot draw conclusions regarding the relative effects of any of the interventions on 30‐day mortality or serious adverse events due to the very low quality of the evidence. The quality of the evidence is limited by the very small number of trials, the small sample sizes, and the risks of bias in the included trials. It is important for future trials to clearly define their inclusion criteria, which will help with the applicability of future trial results to a real‐life population. Management of NSTI participants (critically‐ill participants) is complex, involving multiple interventions; thus, observational studies and prospective registries might be a better foundation for future research, which should assess empiric antimicrobial therapy, as well as surgical debridement, along with the placebo‐controlled comparison of adjuvant therapy. Key outcomes to assess include mortality (in the acute phase of the condition) and long‐term functional outcomes, e.g. quality of life (in the chronic phase). Plain language summary Treatments for necrotizing (i.e. destructive) soft tissue infections in adults What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? We wanted to find out which medicines and surgical treatments are effective and safe for treating necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI). NSTI are serious infections of the tissues underneath the skin, mostly caused by bacteria. Key messages The available evidence from three studies is not strong enough to enable us to draw definite conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of the different treatments for NSTI assessed in this review. All studies assessed number of deaths and risk of serious side effects. Factors affecting our confidence in the results included the following: ‐ the small number of trials and participants; ‐ weaknesses in the trial methodologies which affect the reliability of results; and ‐ poor definition of the participants’ condition. We found no evidence that assessed antimicrobial therapy (which targets a wide range of disease‐causing bacteria and fungi) or surgical removal of damaged tissue. In future studies, risk of death should be a key outcome in the short term (i.e. within 30 days) phase of the condition, and outcomes such as loss of work and quality of life should be assessed in the long‐term phase (after 30 days). What was studied in the review? We included people with NSTI. These types of infections are rare, but can become life‐threatening if left untreated, or result in amputation. NSTIs need emergency treatment, usually with antibiotics and surgical removal of the infected tissue. We searched for studies that assessed treatments for diagnosed NSTI in hospitalised adults. This included: ‐ surgical treatments: surgical removal of damaged tissue compared with amputation, immediate versus delayed treatment, or comparison of a number of treatments; ‐ antimicrobial medicines ‐ which kill bacteria and fungi ‐ compared with placebo (i.e. an identical but inactive treatment), or each other; ‐ medicines given as add‐on therapies in addition to the primary treatment (adjuvant therapies) compared with placebo, no treatment, or other adjuvant therapies. Our main outcomes of interest were death within 30 days, and any serious treatment side effects. What are the main results of the review? We found three studies, which enrolled 197 adults (117 men, average age = 55). The trials were conducted worldwide, funded by pharmaceutical companies; they assessed antimicrobial therapy or treatments that control the immune system. One study compared two antibiotics: moxifloxacin and amoxicillin‐clavulanate, administered directly into a vein for seven to 21 days. It found no clear difference between the treatment groups in terms of number of deaths within 30 days, but we are uncertain about this result because it is based on very low‐certainty evidence. One study compared placebo with a new type of treatment that controls immune response (called AB103) given in a single dose (of either 0.5 mg/kg or 0.25 mg/kg), administered directly into a vein. Participants also received standard treatment for NSTI based on antibiotics and surgical treatment, so AB103 was given as an adjuvant therapy. There was no clear difference between the treatment groups in terms of number of deaths within 30 days, but we are uncertain about this conclusion because it is based on very low‐certainty evidence. One study compared injections of immunoglobulin (an antibody, part of the body’s immune system) with placebo. Both treatments were given for three consecutive days. Participants also received standard treatment for NSTI based on antibiotics and surgical treatment, thus immunoglobulin was given as an adjuvant therapy.

CD003170.PUB4,"Abstract - Background Asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration are visible lesions that are risk factors for later retinal detachment. Retinal detachments occur when fluid in the vitreous cavity passes through tears or holes in the retina and separates the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Creation of an adhesion surrounding retinal breaks and lattice degeneration, with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy, has been recommended as an effective means of preventing retinal detachment. This therapy is of value in the management of retinal tears associated with the symptoms of flashes and floaters and persistent vitreous traction upon the retina in the region of the retinal break, because such symptomatic retinal tears are associated with a high rate of progression to retinal detachment. Retinal tears and holes unassociated with acute symptoms and lattice degeneration are significantly less likely to be the sites of retinal breaks that are responsible for later retinal detachment. Nevertheless, treatment of these lesions frequently is recommended, in spite of the fact that the effectiveness of this therapy is unproven. Objectives The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to treat asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for the prevention of retinal detachment. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2014), PubMed (January 1948 to February 2014), the  meta Register of Controlled Trials ( m RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 19 February 2014. Textbooks regarding retinal detachment and the reference lists of relevant reports were reviewed for additional study reports. We contacted experts in the field for details of other published and unpublished studies. Selection criteria This review was designed to include randomized controlled trials in which one treatment for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration was compared with another treatment or no treatment. Data collection and analysis Initially, one author assessed the search results and collected relevant studies. Since no studies met the inclusion criteria, no studies were assessed for risk of bias. No data were extracted and no meta‐analysis could be performed. Main results No trials were found that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions No conclusions could be reached about the effectiveness of surgical interventions to prevent retinal detachment in eyes with asymptomatic retinal breaks or lattice degeneration, or both. Current recommendations for treatment, based upon a consensus of expert opinion, should be assessed in a randomized controlled trial. Plain language summary Interventions for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for preventing retinal detachment Review question  We reviewed the evidence about whether treatment of retinal breaks (holes or tears in the retina) and retinal lattice degeneration (thinning and atrophy of retinal tissue) can prevent retinal detachment, a serious vision‐threatening problem. Background  The retina is composed of membraneous layers at the back of the eye. It is the part of the eye that converts visual images into information interpreted by the brain as vision. Sometimes, retinal tissue can tear (known as retinal breaks). The effects of the tearing may cause visual disturbances such as dark floaters or flashing lights. When retinal breaks develop without symptoms, they are termed asymptomatic. Retinal lattice degeneration is a condition associated with retinal breaks in which the retinal tissue breaks down or thins in a lattice pattern. When a retinal break occurs, fluid from the eye may leak between layers of the retina, specifically between the sensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium, and cause separation. This separation is known as retinal detachment. Because retinal breaks and lattice degeneration are associated with retinal detachment, treatment of these conditions has been proposed as a way to prevent retinal detachment. Laser therapy or cryotherapy (freezing), or both, are often used with the goal of eliminating the fluid and space between retinal layers. Results  The author of this review discovered no relevant studies. There is no evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of prophylactic therapy for asymptomatic tears or holes in the retina. The evidence is current to February 2014.",Interventions for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for preventing retinal detachment,Wilkinson and  CP,2,3,,
CD004742.PUB2,"Abstract - Background To date, standard recommendations for the management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) would be either pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) or surgery. A new form of drug treatment with a serotonin‐noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), duloxetine, may now have a place in treatment of this condition. Objectives To determine whether a SNRI is better than placebo (or no treatment, other pharmacological and non‐pharmacological therapies, or surgery) in the treatment of women with SUI, or mixed urinary incontinence that includes stress incontinence (MUI), or both and which doses should be used. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 5th March 2007), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2006, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2007), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (7 February 2007) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of treatment for SUI or MUI, in which at least one management arm involved a SNRI. Data collection and analysis Two authors evaluated the trials for appropriateness for inclusion and methodological quality. Three authors performed the data extraction using predetermined criteria. Analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan. Main results Ten randomised trials were included, involving 3944 adults with predominantly SUI, randomised to receive duloxetine or placebo and/ or PFMT. All arms in individual trials were comparable for various baseline characteristics. Treatment duration was between three weeks and 12 weeks. Duloxetine was significantly better than placebo in terms of improving patients' quality of life (weighted mean difference 5.26, 95% confidence interval 3.84 to 6.68. P less than 0.00001) and perception of improvement. Individual studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the Incontinence Episode Frequency (IEF) by approximately 50% during treatment with duloxetine. With regard to objective cure, however, meta‐analysis of stress pad test and 24 hour pad weight change failed to demonstrate a benefit for duloxetine over placebo though data were relatively few. Subjective cure favoured duloxetine, albeit with a small effect size (3%). One trial suggested that duloxetine was better than pelvic floor muscle training alone in reducing IEF (P less than 0.05) based on median percentage decrease in IEF per week. Although significant side effects were commonly associated with duloxetine, they were reported as acceptable. Authors' conclusions The available evidence suggests that duloxetine treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with stress urinary incontinence, but it is unclear whether or not benefits are sustainable. Adverse effects are common but not serious. About one in three participants allocated duloxetine reported adverse effects (most commonly nausea) related to treatment, and about one in eight allocated duloxetine stopped treatment as a consequence. Plain language summary Duloxetine can improve the quality of life of patients with stress urinary incontinence, long‐term effects of the treatment are unclear. Stress urinary incontinence is involuntary urine leakage on coughing or exertion. The trials reviewed compared duloxetine against dummy placebo tablets and also pelvic floor muscle training in women with predominantly stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine reduced the frequency of episodes of incontinence and improved quality of life scores. However, it had little impact on the numbers cured and commonly had side effects, especially nausea. More studies comparing a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor with placebo and surgery are required, especially if conducted independently of pharmaceutical companies.",Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) for stress urinary incontinence in adults,Mariappan and  P; Alhasso and  AA; Grant and  A; N'Dow and  JMO,2,3,,
CD008212.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common gynaecological condition accounting for 20% of all gynaecological referrals. There are wide ranges of causes with overlapping symptomatology, therefore the management of the condition is a formidable challenge for clinicians. The aetiology of CPP is heterogeneous and in many cases, no clear diagnosis can be reached. It is in this scenario that the label of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) can be applied. We defined women with CPPS as having a minimum duration of pain of at least 6 months, including with a diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome, but excluding pain caused by a condition such as endometriosis. Many surgical interventions have been tried in isolation or in conjunction with non‐surgical interventions in the management with variable results. Surgical interventions are invasive and carry operative risks. Surgical interventions must be evaluated for their effectiveness prior to their prevalent use in the management of women with CPPS. Objectives To review the effectiveness and safety of surgical interventions in the management of women with CPPS. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO, on 23 April 2021 for any randomised controlled trials (RCT) for surgical interventions in women with CPPS. We also searched the citation lists of relevant publications, two trial registries, relevant journals, abstracts, conference proceedings and several key grey literature sources. Selection criteria RCTs with women who had CPPS. The review authors were prepared to consider studies of any surgical intervention used for the management of CPPS. Outcome measures were pain rating scales, adverse events, psychological outcomes, quality of life (QoL) measures and requirement for analgesia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently evaluated studies for inclusion and extracted data using the forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. For each included trial, we collected information regarding the method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, data reporting and analyses. We reported pooled results as mean difference (MDs) or odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by the Mantel‐Haenszel method. If similar outcomes were reported on different scales, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD). We applied GRADE criteria to judge the overall certainty of the evidence. Main results Four studies met our inclusion criteria involving 216 women with CPP and no identifiable cause. Adhesiolysis compared to no surgery or diagnostic laparoscopy We are uncertain of the effect of adhesiolysis on pelvic pain scores postoperatively at three months (MD −7.3, 95% CI −29.9 to 15.3; 1 study, 43 participants; low‐certainty evidence), six months (MD −14.3, 95% CI −35.9 to 7.3; 1 study, 43 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 12 months postsurgery (MD 0.00, 95% CI −4.60 to 4.60; 1 study, 43 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adhesiolysis may improve both the emotional wellbeing (MD 24.90, 95% CI 7.92 to 41.88; 1 study, 43 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and social support (MD 23.90, 95% CI −1.77 to 49.57; 1 study, 43 participants; low‐certainty evidence) components of the Endometriosis Health Profile‐30, and both the emotional component (MD 32.30, 95% CI 13.16 to 51.44; 1 study, 43 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and the physical component of the 12‐item Short Form (MD 22.90, 95% CI 10.97 to 34.83; 1 study, 43 participants; low‐certainty evidence) when compared to diagnostic laparoscopy. We are uncertain of the safety of adhesiolysis compared to comparator groups due to low‐certainty evidence and lack of structured adverse event reporting. No studies reported on psychological outcomes or requirements for analgesia. Laparoscopic uterosacral ligament ablation or resection compared to diagnostic laparoscopy/other treatment We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic uterosacral ligament/nerve ablation (LUNA) or resection compared to other treatments postoperatively at three months (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.93; 1 study, 51 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and six months (MD −2.10, 95% CI −4.38 to 0.18; 1 study, 74 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). At 12 months post‐surgery, we are uncertain of the effect of LUNA on the rate of successful treatment compared to diagnostic laparoscopy. One study of 56 participants found no difference in the effect of LUNA on non‐cyclical pain (P = 0.854) or dyspareunia (P = 0.41); however, there was a difference favouring LUNA on dysmenorrhea (P = 0.045) and dyschezia (P = 0.05). We are also uncertain of the effect of LUNA compared to vaginal uterosacral ligament resection on pelvic pain at 12 months (MD 2.00, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.53; 1 study, 74 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the safety of LUNA or resection compared to comparator groups due to the lack of structured adverse event reporting. Women undergoing LUNA may require more analgesia postoperatively than those undergoing other treatments (P < 0.001; 1 study, 74 participants). No studies reported psychological outcomes or QoL. Authors' conclusions We are uncertain about the benefit of adhesiolysis or LUNA in management of pain in women with CPPS based on the current literature. There may be a QoL benefit to adhesiolysis in improving both emotional wellbeing and social support, as measured by the validated QoL tools. It was not possible to synthesis evidence on adverse events as these were only reported narratively in some studies, in which none were observed. With the inadequate objective assessment of adverse events, especially long‐term adverse events, associated with adhesiolysis or LUNA for CPPS, there is currently little to support these interventions for CPPS. Plain language summary Surgical management of chronic pelvic pain in women Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out whether there are any effective and safe surgical treatments for women with chronic pelvic pain. We wanted to understand how effective these surgical treatments are compared to alternative treatments or no treatment at all. Background Chronic pelvic pain in women is a common and debilitating condition. Definitions vary, but generally it is defined as pelvic pain for a period of six months or greater. There are many causes of chronic pelvic pain, but these can sometimes be difficult to identify. Regardless of identifying any or the specific cause, treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms. Occasionally, a diagnostic surgery with insertion of laparoscope is completed (inserting a telescope into the belly to visualise pelvic structures). When identifiable causes of chronic pelvic pain are present, such as endometriosis (tissue similar to the lining of the womb that starts to grow in other places) or adenomyosis (tissue similar to the lining of the womb is found deep in the muscle of the womb), there may be different treatment strategies necessary than when there are no obvious problems. When no disease is identified at the time of a diagnostic surgery despite chronic pelvic pain, we may consider various surgical procedures to treat the chronic pelvic pain, including removing scar tissue originating from infection or previous operation (called adhesiolysis), or cauterising (heat treatment) or excising (removing) the nerves carrying the pain sensation from pelvis to brain (called uterosacral ligament ablation/resection). Despite it being unclear how effective these surgical treatments are, they are being offered and done. What we found We found four randomised controlled trials (a type of study that gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of treatment) involving 216 women with chronic pelvic pain and no identifiable cause. The main outcome measures were pain scores after surgery and quality of life. The evidence is current to 23 April 2021. Key results Adhesiolysis versus no surgery/diagnostic laparoscopy We are uncertain of the effect of adhesiolysis compared with diagnostic laparoscopy on pain scores at three, six and 12 months after surgery. Pain was measured using a visual analogue score (VAS), which is a widely used rating scale where the person ranks pain from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain). Adhesiolysis may improve health‐related quality of life at six months after surgery when compared to diagnostic laparoscopy. Laparoscopic uterosacral ligament ablation versus other treatment We are uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic uterosacral ligament ablation (LUNA) versus diagnostic laparoscopy or vaginal uterosacral ligament resection, on pain scores measured by VAS at three, six and 12 months. Women undergoing LUNA may require more pain relief after surgery than those undergoing alternative treatments. No studies in either comparison reported on psychological outcomes. Certainty of evidence The certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low. Limitations included poor reporting of study methods and imprecision (too few events, too few included studies) for some comparisons.",Surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain in women,Leonardi and  M; Armour and  M; Gibbons and  T; Cave and  AE; As-Sanie and  S; Condous and  G; Cheong and  YC,2,3,,
CD000200.PUB2,"Abstract - Background There is considerable international variation in the rate and indications of surgery for primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma, reflecting the uncertainty about the effects of surgery. Recently, some large randomised trials have appeared in the literature but the controversy over its role continues. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1997, and previously updated in 1999. Objectives To assess the effects of surgery plus routine medical management, compared with routine medical management alone, in patients with primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2007), checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of relevant trials. In addition, for the original version of this review we handsearched two journals,  Current Opinion in Neurology and Neurosurgery , and  Neurosurgical Clinics of North America  (1991 to July 1993), and three monographs. We contacted study authors for relevant information. Selection criteria Randomised trials of routine medical treatment plus intracranial surgery compared with routine medical treatment alone in patients with CT‐confirmed primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma. Intracranial surgery included craniotomy, stereotactic endoscopic evacuation or stereotactic aspiration. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. Main results Ten trials with 2059 participants were included. The quality of most of the trials was acceptable but not high. Because of this and as the overall result was sensitive to the losses to follow up in the largest trial, the estimates of effect may not be robust and may be subject to bias. Surgery was associated with statistically significant reduction in the odds of being dead or dependent at final follow up (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.88; 2P = 0.001) with no significant heterogeneity among the study results. Surgery was also associated with significant reduction in the odds of death at final follow up (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90; 2P = 0.003); however, there was significant heterogeneity for death as outcome. Authors' conclusions In patients with CT‐proven primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage, surgery added to medical management reduces the odds of being dead or dependent compared with medical management alone, but the result is not very robust. Hence, further randomised trials to identify which patients benefit from surgery and to evaluate less invasive methods are indicated. Plain language summary Surgery for primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage There is evidence of benefit from surgical removal of the blood clot formed after a stroke due to bleeding in the brain. Most strokes are due to the blockage of an artery to one part of the brain; these are called ischaemic strokes. Some strokes occur because blood leaks from a blood vessel into the brain matter where it clots; this is called a brain haemorrhage and is an event that threatens life, limbs and speech. Various types of surgical operation can be performed to remove the blood blot, with the aim of improving the patient's chance of being alive and independent after the stroke. The review authors set out to determine whether surgery within 24 to 72 hours of onset of symptoms decreases the risk of death or dependence; and whether one surgical technique is better than another. Endoscopic or stereotactic surgery inserts a fine catheter rather than having to open up the skull (craniotomy) to get to the blood clot. This updated review included 10 studies in which a total of 2059 participants received medical treatment, but 50% also had surgery within 72 hours of onset of the event. Surgery was associated with significant benefit and improved the proportion of participants alive and independent. However, the benefit was not consistent in all the studies, which suggests that this result may not be very reliable. Overall, surgery appeared promising, though further trials are underway to identify the type of patients most likely to benefit from surgery.",Surgery for primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage,Prasad and  K; Mendelow and  AD; Gregson and  B,3,1,,
CD005493.PUB3,"Abstract - Background Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a common condition with a significant negative impact on quality of life characterised by urgency with or without urge incontinence, frequency and nocturia.  Intravesical botulinum toxin is being increasingly used to treat severe overactive bladder refractory to standard management.  An increasing body of literature is forming that supports this technique as effective, well tolerated, and safe.  This review is a substantial update of the 2007 review of the same title. Objectives The objective was to compare intravesical botulinum toxin with other treatments for neurogenic and idiopathic overactive bladder in adults. The hypothesis to be addressed were whether intravesical injection of botulinum toxin was better than placebo or no treatment; pharmacological and other non‐pharmacological interventions; whether higher doses of botulinum toxin were better than lower doses; whether botulinum toxin in combination with other treatments was better than other treatments alone; whether one formulation of botulinum toxin is better than another; and whether one injection technique was better than another. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 23 February 2010). The Register contains trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. Additionally, all reference lists of selected trials and relevant review papers were searched. No limitations were placed on the searches. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of treatment for OAB in adults in which at least one management arm involved intravesical injection of botulinum toxin were included. Participants had either neurogenic OAB or idiopathic OAB with or without stress incontinence. Comparison interventions could include no intervention, placebo, lifestyle modification, bladder retraining, pharmacological treatments, surgery, bladder instillation techniques, neuromodulation, and different types, doses, and injection techniques of botulinum toxin. Data collection and analysis Binary outcomes were presented as relative risk and continuous outcomes by mean differences. Little data could be synthesised across studies due to differing study designs and outcome measures. Where applicable standard deviations were calculated from P values according to the formula described in section 7.7.3.3 of the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data were tabulated where possible with results taken from trial reports where this was not possible. Where multiple publications were found, the reports were treated as a single source of data. Main results Nineteen studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria.  Most patients in the studies had neurogenic OAB, but some included patients with idiopathic OAB.  All studies demonstrated superiority of botulinum toxin to placebo.  Lower doses of botulinum toxin (100 to 150 U) appeared to have beneficial effects, but larger doses (300 U) may have been more effective and longer lasting, but with more side effects.  Suburothelial injection had comparable efficacy to intradetrusor injection. The effect of botulinum toxin may last for a number of months and is dependent upon dose and type of toxin used. Patients receiving repeated doses do not seem to become refractory to botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin appeared to have beneficial effects in OAB that quantitatively exceeded the effects of intravesical resiniferatoxin. Intravesical botulinum toxin appeared to be reasonably safe; however, one study was halted due to a perceived unacceptable rate of urinary retention.  Authors' conclusions Intravesical botulinum toxin appears to be an effective therapy for refractory OAB symptoms, but as yet little controlled trial data exist on benefits and safety compared with other interventions, or with placebo. Further robust data are required on long term outcomes, safety, and optimal dose of botulinum toxin for OAB. Plain language summary Botulinum toxin injections into the bladder for overactive bladder syndrome in adults Injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder is being increasingly used to treat persistent overactive bladder (OAB). This is a disorder characterised by the sudden urge to pass urine with or without incontinence, a frequent need to pass urine, and waking to pass urine during the night. We explored the research relating to how effective and safe botulinum toxin injections into the bladder are, and what the best dose of botulinum toxin is, and what is the best way of injecting it into the bladder. We found that there were several comparative studies, but these involved a relatively small number of patients. There was evidence that botulinum toxin improves the symptoms of OAB. It was unclear what the best dose of botulinum toxin was. Botulinum toxin injections into the bladder appeared to give few side effects or complications, but there were no long‐term follow‐up studies, and there could be rare side effects that have not been discovered yet.",Botulinum toxin injections for adults with overactive bladder syndrome,Duthie and  JB; Vincent and  M; Herbison and  GP; Wilson and  DI; Wilson and  D,2,3,,
CD013535.PUB2,"Abstract - Background Periorbital and orbital cellulitis are infections of the tissue anterior and posterior to the orbital septum, respectively, and can be difficult to differentiate clinically. Periorbital cellulitis can also progress to become orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis has a relatively high incidence in children and adults, and potentially serious consequences including vision loss, meningitis, and death. Complications occur in part due to inflammatory swelling from the infection creating a compartment syndrome within the bony orbit, leading to elevated ocular pressure and compression of vasculature and the optic nerve. Corticosteroids are used in other infections to reduce this inflammation and edema, but they can lead to immune suppression and worsening infection. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis, and to assess their effectiveness and safety in children and in adults separately. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 March 2020. Selection criteria We included studies of participants diagnosed with periorbital or orbital cellulitis. We excluded studies that focused exclusively on participants who were undergoing elective endoscopic surgery, including management of infections postsurgery as well as studies conducted solely on trauma patients. Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Any study that administered corticosteroids was eligible regardless of type of steroid, route of administration, length of therapy, or timing of treatment. Comparators could include placebo, another corticosteroid, no treatment control, or another intervention. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Main results The search yielded 7998 records, of which 13 were selected for full‐text screening. We identified one trial for inclusion. No other eligible ongoing or completed trials were identified. The included study compared the use of corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics to the use of antibiotics alone for the treatment of orbital cellulitis. The study included a total of 21 participants aged 10 years and older, of which 14 participants were randomized to corticosteroids and antibiotics and 7 participants to antibiotics alone. Participants randomized to corticosteroids and antibiotics received adjunctive corticosteroids after initial antibiotic response (mean 5.13 days), at an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg for three days followed by 1 mg/kg for another three days before being tapered over a one‐ to two‐week period. We assessed the included study as having an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, masking (blinding), selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Risk of bias from sequence generation and incomplete outcome data were low. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, downgraded for risk of bias (‐1) and imprecision (‐2). Length of hospital stay was compared between the group receiving antibiotics alone compared to the group receiving antibiotics and corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) 4.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.48 to 9.08; 21 participants). There was no observed difference in duration of antibiotics between treatment groups (MD 3.00, 95% CI −0.48 to 6.48; 21 participants). Likewise, preservation of visual acuity at 12 weeks of follow‐up between group was also assessed (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 21 participants). Pain scores were compared between groups on day 3 (MD −0.20, 95% CI −1.02 to 0.62; 22 eyes) along with the need for surgical intervention (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.23; 21 participants). Exposure keratopathy was reported in five participants who received corticosteroids and antibiotics and three participants who received antibiotic alone (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.63; 21 participants). No major complications of orbital cellulitis were seen in either the intervention or the control group. No side effects of corticosteroids were reported, although it is unclear which side effects were assessed. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of periorbital and orbital cellulitis. Since there is significant variation in how corticosteroids are used in clinical practice, additional high‐quality evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed to inform decision making. Future studies should explore the effects of corticosteroids in children and adults separately, and evaluate different dosing and timing of corticosteroid therapy. Plain language summary Corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis What is the aim of this review? We aimed to find out if steroids are useful in treating serious infections of the area around the eye known as periorbital and orbital cellulitis. These infections can lead to complications like blindness, brain infection, or death. We also wanted to see if steroids worked the same or differently in children and adults. Key messages We do not know if steroids are useful in treating periorbital and orbital cellulitis. We identified only one small study that looked at this topic, which showed that there may be a benefit to using steroids and antibiotics together. However, larger and higher‐quality studies are needed to better understand this topic. What was studied in this review? Periorbital and orbital cellulitis are potentially serious infections of the area around the eye. These infections are usually treated in hospital, as they can cause serious complications. One contributing factor to the development of these complications is that there is limited space in the bony structures that surround the eye. When these spaces get swollen as a result of infection, the pressure inside the space increases, which can damage the eye. Steroids are medications that can reduce swelling, but they can also affect the body’s ability to fight infection. There are no clear guidelines on whether or not to use steroids to treat periorbital and orbital cellulitis, and there is a lot of variation in how these conditions are currently treated among doctors. Our review used standard methods to identify studies that assigned patients to receive either steroids or another treatment using a random method, and then compared the results. What are the main results of the review? We found one study that compared using only antibiotics to using both antibiotics and steroids to treat periorbital and orbital cellulitis. The study included 21 people, 7 who only received antibiotics and 14 who received both antibiotics and steroids. The study included people 10 years or older, but did not see if there were any differences between how children and adults respond to steroids. The study found that people receiving steroids and antibiotics together needed antibiotics for less time and had improved symptoms earlier than the group that received antibiotics alone. There was no difference in length of hospital stay between people receiving steroids and antibiotics and those receiving only antibiotics. However, because there is only one small study on this topic, it is hard to tell if all patients with periorbital and orbital cellulitis should be given steroids with antibiotics; more research is needed before any formal recommendations can be made. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies published up to 2 March 2020.",Corticosteroids for periorbital and orbital cellulitis,Kornelsen and  E; Mahant and  S; Parkin and  P; Ren and  LY; Reginald and  YA; Shah and  SS; Gill and  PJ,2,3,,
